 on 6 April 2014 // Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year, even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By

(no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

 on 20 Nov. 2013 // I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set. | Excellent introduction  to the hobby. // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 26 Oct. 2014 // Every child should own a train set, and lately I've started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too, so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And,  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot, that's OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone, whilst building titchy windmills).It's nice to see, after not handling  a set since the early 70s, that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel, lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service, with both passenger and freight carriages, but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game, and the price is what it is: They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally, whereas this is on an old style analogue controller, which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains, etc, this  set would have to run on a separate track?So, I'm really glad i own a trainset again, and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump. | Great starter set, but do your research // 4.0 // 3 Jan. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 3 Jan. 2015 // My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops, museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before, but it is clearly well thought out, very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was, it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge, but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set, it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics, but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy, very classic, but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge, to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example, but to go up you need to slope very very gradually, otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space, and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6), as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""KNC Toys"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£65.00""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£69.99""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£79.95""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Gameseek"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£80.48""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""CLIFFORD JAMES"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£79.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Frome Models Centre"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£89.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""TrainStop"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£91.99""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Models & Computers Plus"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£92.99""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""GamesQuest"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£104.99""}]}"

 on 30 April 2011 // I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play, without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get's so excited everytime he gets a new engine, as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas, Spencer, Percy, Diesel, Toby,and some other's. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It's great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender's. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I've seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines, making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him, and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment, I wish it was made plain in Amazon's product details which ones talk and don't. Which are die cast etc, I find myself sometimes going through products for an age, or going to other sites, to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I'm always pleased with the service, but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier.

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said, I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!), the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal! | LNER'S Flying Scotsman. // 4.0 // 3 Nov. 2012 // By

 on 3 Nov. 2012 // This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set, I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches, oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A,B,C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set, and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail, you can see into the windows, each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one, and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost, I would not let young children play with it on their own, but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Especially as discounted by Amazon, this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models, or of some of the others in the market, e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality, but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn't use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard, and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it's held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it's already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. It's really disappointing to find that it's many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless. | Better than expected // 5.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2012 // Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat, we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly, the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track, carriages and engine, it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on! | Boyhood dream fulfilled - after fifty years!

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 26 Dec. 2014 // Purchased as a Christmas present, to entertain the family when all stuck under one roof. You can play it two ways. Civilised and with everyone taking a turn, or more as the game suggests, shaking the dice and grabbing for the card you want so you can collect you card sets before anyone else. But be warned, if you pick up a card with a corresponding dice that chimes ... you can't have it. If you play the second version make sure you've got plenty of room and there are no breakables within the immediate area. Especially if over enthusiastic children are playing!  Really good fun.

 on 30 Jan. 2016 // Really pleased to have found this game. Very simple concept.  In essence, you roll the dice try and match a letter on the dice to any one of the 9 face-up cards products and you win that card ... Almost!!  If you pick a dice with a bell then you don't win the card.  The aim is to collect 2 sets of coloured cards.  Simple to pick up.  Quite a small box so quite transportable.

 on 17 Dec. 2010 // This is a great game for 2-4 players, comprising nine dice with a different letter on each face. A player rolls the dice and then has the opportunity to roll each dice again up to three times with the objective of making the highest scoring word. Each player takes a turn, and the scores are totted up. Play resumes back with the first player until a player reaches a pre-decided winning total.The way the scoring system works is quite clever too, in that there is a compromise between the length of the word and complexity of it, as each letter has a different score associated with it. To score the turn, the number of letters in the word is multiplied by the score of each of those letters (the tube includes a multiplication table to ease you through this).This is a rewarding game where the chance element is large enough to bridge gaps between different intelligence levels, but an enjoyable experience for all. I would recommend this as a family activity, or for out and about, as it takes up almost no space. | Letter Dice // 5.0 // 22 Aug. 2010 // By

 on 6 Jan. 2011 // This game is fantastic. I'd been trying to invent a tactical, strategic game myself that just uses dice. I had thought about lettered dice also, but this guy just seems to have hit the nail on the head. It's very good.I was playing it last night and invented a patience version whereby you can actually play/challenge the dice.Basically you play as usual, but when it comes to the ""dice's turn"" you roll all 9 dice, then remove the vowels leaving just the consonants. You must remove at least 3 vowels. If you could only remove 2 max, then roll the remaining consonants again to produce more vowels to remove. The Dice similarly have 3 rolls max per turn but only if required. If after 1 or 2 rolls the minimum 3 vowels have been removed you then stop rolling. If after 3 rolls you have still only managed to remove 2 vowels max then that is just hard luck. You then add up the word value of the consonants as you would a real word, then multiply by how many consonants, again as you would a real word.? = vowel but Y does not. | Simple but brilliant // 5.0 // 20 Nov. 2009 // By

 on 20 Nov. 2009 // Like many of the best ideas, Dicewords is very simple and the rules can be learned in a couple of minutes.  It has elements of Scrabble and Boggle (and no doubt other word games) but at the same time has its own unique character. It's extremely flexible: it can be played anywhere, with any number of people, for any length of time, and with any level of skill. It can be enjoyed by everyone - from the 6-year-old who can spell a couple of dozen words to the hardened Scrabble fanatic. However, what I personally enjoy most about it is the collaborative element. While Scrabble tends to generate long silences as players struggle with impossible letter combinations, and Boggle creates frantic mayhem while everyone races each other to get the most words, Dicewords invariably seems to encourage co-operation between players. Although each player has their own turn with their own letters, everyone else can watch them put a word together and this often ends up as a group activity. Most of my best words have been made with other people's letters! This does, of course, mean that winning the game is a rather random affair, but it's a great deal more fun than sitting silently for an hour or so. For this reason, it works well as a party game and is a great icebreaker if you have friends who don't know each other well. Of course, it can also be played in a deadly serious and competitive fashion, if that's what you want. Anyone who enjoys word games will love this, and I can imagine it would work very well in an educational environment too. | dice words // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2009 // By

Extend your imagination by taking 1 dice and when the picture comes up do not take it at face value.

 on 21 Oct. 2013 // I must admit to being a tiny bit hooked on these things.You get nice models,opening the 'windows' is always fun as well.You will never get bored because the bricks just get added to the collection.I've found that there are always quite a few duplicate bricks among the sets,which is a nice bonus.Also....don't chuck away the box,there are 24 inner plastic compartments which are ideal for storing the smaller bricks or,as my wife has found out,great for planting seedlings.You really can't lose with these sets! | good // 5.0 // 21 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 7 Dec. 2013 // Every year, it's the one advent calendar we absolutely must have.  For around one quid per window, it's a bargain as well as lots of fun making up the various characters or items such as miniature ships.  I've been accused of buying this for myself rather than my son, but what parent would be that cruel?  Of course it's for him!  Absolutely, and unequivocally.There are no disappointments in this calendar, there haven't been any disappointments in the past seven calendars we've had over the years.  Some things are cooler, but nothing is bad or boring or less than fun.  Beats chocolate, any time. | Great Idea // 4.0 // 9 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 12 Dec. 2013 // i bought this for my husbands 40th birthday, we got last years calendar and he was thrilled with it, so i had no problem at all buying him this years. the novelty is fantastic, there is a flap that comes down at the front for your models to stand on and the box is decorated with a festive design. he loves to sit down at the table with our children and build the model of the day.we even have a display case on our wall so that the mini figures that come with the sets are on show all the time. a great buy for any star wars lego lover!! | Such a good idea // 5.0 // 3 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 3 Jan. 2014 // What do you get for your 6 year old son who likes Star Wars minifigures, but is not keen on building Lego?  This calendar was a great present in the build up to Christmas.  There are 24 models, about  half are minifigures of some sort, the rest are very easy to put together battle ships.  Every day was like Christmas day, before going to school.  We got the Lego City calendar for our other son (v good too).  On Dec 25 each child only got one present and some books.

In the USA a dump truck or dumper is also a tipper, but which only tips out or empties the transported materials at the back.

 on 7 Jan. 2012 // We bought this for our 4 year old son for Christmas although I actually got it when it was on offer at £31.99 in September. I agree with another reviewer in that this is a fair price for it. I don't think it's worth paying more than about £50 for it and can't believe it's actually on sale at £128.00 as I'm writing this.We have quite a few bits from Imaginext and although this is a great toy we've encountered a problem with the lift winding mechanism almost as soon as my son started playing with it which has meant the lift doesn't work properly. I would have brushed this off as a one off however we have the fire station set as well and the fire engine hose obviously works on the same system and that stopped working quite quickly too. I think we can fix the lift issue with a bit of DIY repair work but it's still annoying to have to do it. But it is still a fun toy*****Update*****After contacting Mattel about the lift problem and getting an unsatisfactory reply and no idea how to fix it I researched it online and found lots of people have had the same problem.. For anyone else who has this problem it can be fixed relatively easily once you know how! Unscrew the screws that hold the red bit into the reel and the ones that attach it to the main structure but not the screws that keep the black reel together. Wind the string around the black reel twice so it's very taut and then get it back in place and screwed in without the string coming out again. And hey presto, a working lift!! I did think I was going to go crazy though trying to do it so I'm keeping my stars at 3. | great // 5.0 // 16 Sept. 2011 // By

 on 31 Dec. 2012 // After seeing the advert on telly, my son wanted the Imaginext Batcave so he could put the bad guys in jail.  Came Xmas morning, he was overjoyed to unwrap his batcave.  However, he was bitterly disappointed to see that the jail door was missing.  After checking everywhere in the box, I could not locate said door.  I contacted customer service and they responded promptly, promising to send the door in the post.  Received package in the post this morning containing a part that does not fit, as a matter of fact, it doesn't even seem to be part of this playset.  Now had to contact them again.  GRRRR.  The lift is already a bit tempermental, as well.For the price they charge for this large piece of plastic, is it too much to expect that it, at least, come with all the parts included?

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 21 Nov. 2011 // We already have several toys from the Imaginext range.  They are all built like tanks and my son adores playing with them for hours on end.  Once the Batcave is released from its packaging there are a couple of bits to clip on, but it's basically fully assembled.  My son is 5 years old, and when he's on his knees playing with his Batcave, it's as tall as he is - a substantial toy.  There is a gun that fires a missile, a crane arm, a prison cell, a telescope, a light up batman sign, a lift that goes up and down, a turntable for Robin's bike... and probably a lot more that I've forgotten to mention.  In the words of my very excited son, ""there's just so much to do, Daddy!"".  The set includes the Batcave, Batman and Robin characters, a missile for the launcher, a bike (which fits Robin only) a couple of tools, a bat computer and a pair of clip on wings for Batman.  I can't begin to tell you how pleased my son is with this toy.  His face lit up like you wouldn't believe when he started to unwrap it. | Last minute purchase // 5.0 // 25 Mar. 2013 // By

 on 28 July 2013 // In our house, where toys get broken fairly easily (3 boys) it is hard to find toys that last more that 10 minutes before getting broken. I have found that imaginext toys seem to be fairly robust. This batcave is great fun for my boys and they play with it all the time, even nearly a year after buying it. It is worth noting that that they also have the old version of this batcave that was much stronger and had less things to fall off/get lost...that is the only downside really, there are more bits on this to fall off, but they are easy to put back on again. The main thing is that they still love this toy....even after owning it for so long.....(Just noticed that there is an even newer version of the batcave now available in a popular high street home shopping catalogue....letters to santa are being written as I speak) | Great toy! // 5.0 // 16 Oct. 2012 // By

It is definitely robust!Also all 3 of their friends have loved it too and got really excited when they saw it!The price seems to have gone down a bit since I bought it and I think it is worth it. Knowing how robust and the amount of time they play with it I would pay more!!It's really worth buying the pack of figures to go with it if you have more than one child though.It's also great that you can add other things to it.

 on 27 July 2014 // Once again Character Options have missed a trick but let's start with the positives. The 'pilot' dalek is wonderfully detailed with the unique colouring of the black/grey head & intermittent side panels plus it is fully posable which surprised me for a 3.75"" figure. The firing canon is extremly powerful & the whole thing looks quite splendid in it's exploded view. Now onto the negatives. This is supposed to be a replica of the Patrol Ships used in the Time War & the panels extended open are supposed to close to make one huge dalek protecting it's pilot which would have looked great ... it doesn't ... you are stuck with it in the exploded view which sort of defeats the object. The panels pop off far too easily (just a plastic ball joint holds them in place) & I can foresee after a few months of removing & replacing them they will simply become loose & fall off. The projectile that fits into the firing cannon is so obviously plastic (the colour dosen't help) it spoils the overall look of the model. Another failing is that on the interior floor of the Patrol Ship are two little slots that the pilot daleks side wheels fit into to hold it in position. The problem is where they are situated because once you place the pilot in position his plunger arm extends beyond the control panel to operate the ship so how is he supposed to work the controls? Little details like this frustrate me & show how little thought or care was put into the design. In a child's hands this would probably not last more than a few days, maybe a couple of weeks if you are really lucky so I am completely confused as to who their target market is ...Read more › | Not Very Exciting // 2.0 // 12 Nov. 2014 // By

 on 12 Nov. 2014 // Disappointing. I have marked this down as the panels don't move to enclose the Dalek pilot. Also, a few lights/sound effects wouldn't have gone amiss.The cannon fires well and the panels do pop off, but that's it. This is more of an adult collectors toy than a childrens's toy which is a shame as my son was swayed by the TV adverts.We also purchased the 12th doctor Sonic Screwdriver and that is being played with constantly whilst this Dalek is left sitting on the shelf. | Cool Dalek toy, but.... // 4.0 // 4 Sept. 2015 // By

How many beads approx per bracelet? // Hi Laura, yes you could but bare in mind that the hole in the middle is quite small so mught be tricky for younger children. Moreover, the beads are tiny for bracelet so would take a lot per bracelet, I'd say (wild guess) around 60 at least. Hope this help. | Do you have you put the board in the paper for ironing // Yes, Once the design is completed you need to place the ironing paper on top of your design & run the hot iron over it.

 on 11 Mar. 2014 // I'm admittedly not the age of the usual target audience for such products, but bought some out of nostalgia and to settle a creative urge. I thought that this bucket was great value, I have made at least 20 things, some fairly large and I'm only about a third of the way down it.If I had any complaints, it's that there doesn't seem to be many black beads in it - a shame because I like to use them as an outline!No pegboards or paper with this, just the beads. Pegboards can be bought separately and grease proof paper can be used instead of having to spend more on the official Hama ironing paper.Overall I was very happy with this as a starter pack, found cheap packs of the black beads as well as brown and grey ones that I wanted online to top it up.The colours you get in this bucket are: Black, white, pink, purple, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and dark green. | Hours of rewarding creative fun, + no brand names or gimmicks. // 5.0 // 21 Oct. 2009 // By

 on 21 Oct. 2009 // We have been huge fans of Hama beads and kits in this house for a couple of years now. My 7 year old makes bracelets and then melts down imaginative pendants for them. She has made picture frames, dolls for removable paper clothes and all sorts of peculiar looking monsters. One recent creation was a hama-bead charm bracelet! My 4 year old son makes pictures of cars, dinosaurs and traffic lights and then plays with them.It is a simple concept. Put small plastic beads onto a plastic board to make a picture. Use some baking paper to iron (on a low setting) to melt the beads together, and then peel the picture off. The ""midi"" beads are suitable for about 3 and a half to 10 (or over. I'm addicted...) you can get much larger beads for smaller children, and much smaller beads for older children and adults. I haven't tried either, and we are sticking to ""midi"" beads for now.There are also the kits with the instructions on how to create the intricate pattern to make really impressive pictures. It would be nice if the manufacturers had a website where they had a few more examples you can copy. I understand that you can get books and things, but we haven't looked at these yet.The only downside is that these creations by their very nature cannot last forever if you play with them constantly or wear them a lot. But truly this toy is an all round winner. Hours of peace for parents, creative play for youngsters, and a praiseworthy creation at the end.Okay, adults, you need to iron for a few seconds after the kids have finished their work, but it is not difficult and doesn't take any time.Read more › | Hama Heaven! // 5.0 // 30 Oct. 2007 // By

 on 26 Jun. 2014 // I bought a box of these after searching Amazon for Christmas presents after reading the reviews and naïvely assuming that the boards required to put the beads on were supplied which I may add was not in the description but as I had never seen or heard about the beads before I hadn't known what to expect. Never mind the boards are inexpensive and totally reusable so the deficit when pointed out by my daughter, was soon rectified. I also assumed wrongly that it would only be my granddaughters who would be interested in the beads, but wrong again, both grandsons also like them. All four children have made a variety of imaginative things from the beads including necklaces, bracelets, table mats, nameplates, wall hangings and birthday greetings pictures for family and friends. All you need is some (reusable) grease proof paper plus an iron and one responsible person, usually a Nana (or similarly qualified person) to drop everything they are doing instantaneously to iron the beads. Actually on Hama bead days I recommend imposing a twice daily arrangement whereby creations can be left at a designated spot and then ironing done in batches. Finishing one item takes about 2 mins. For greater stability (if permitted by the artist), I tend to iron both sides. Using the beads is great when friends come to play as all ages can create things together according to their skill level without feeling in any way left out and with so many beads in a box they last for ages. The shaped boards eg butterfly's or dolphins etc are nice as give a good shape to the designs but are not necessary but do get some large boards for making multiple similar designs eg flowers used for gluing onto a plant pot to decorate it. At the price offered a box of these would make a good gift for many different occasions eg gift for one child to take to another child's birthday party. | 10 000 minutes of peace and quiet // 5.0 // 20 Jan. 2014 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWER on 20 Jan. 2014 // If you are buying Hama beads I would strongly suggest getting this set. The beads will probably land up everywhere, but at least with this big tub you can keep them all together after you've scooped them up with a brush and pan. There are a large variety of colours to choose from in the set but I also bought some extra glow in the dark ones to compliment it.The quality of these beads is great and they're really good value. The tub makes it nice and easy to pack them away after kids may get bored with them (they don't seem to stay bored with them for long though!).Highly recommended.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£12.72""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Just Childsplay"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£12.72""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""PlayMerrily Toys"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£11.96""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Crafty Arts"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£12.48""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""Grasshopper Toys"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£12.50""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""EW Education"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£10.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""World of Toys Ltd"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£12.99""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""World Wide Shopping Mall Ltd"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£15.50""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""Fun Learning"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£15.75""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""em-store"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£15.90""}]}"

It contained: 2 mixed normal band packs (each contained 600 bands), 2 mixed glittery band packs (each contained 600 bands) & 1 pack of mixed metallic bands (contains 600 bands). Also, each packet contains s clips and a hook! You will collect a total of 5 hooks. Brill! The packaging is very well made with a closable packet for easy use.

 on 19 Aug. 2012 // Ordered two of these for my boys age 12 and 15 from amazon. Although I asked for both colours I received both in the flame design, which has not made any difference to the tremendous amount of fun they have both had, in the 8ft pool today; riding on them like rocking horses, diving onto them, shields to defend them selves from mad splash attacks! Taking them on holiday next week to test the Cornish waves.Only negative is they are described as being 44"" x 25 1/2"" well the're not. The actual size is 40"" x 20"" and they say the seam is a bit scratchy, but still great fun...even for a 15year old :) | Such fun - bought instead of a bodyboard // 5.0 // 3 Mar. 2014 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 10 REVIEWER on 5 Nov. 2015 // We bought this on holiday.  It is essentially an inflatable Boogie Board for the pool - your child's legs hang off the rear, in the water.  I wouldn’t use it in surf, personally, as it does not have the rigidity needed (and inflatables at sea are dangerous as wind can carry them away) but it was good in a pool.The plastic seems not very thick but if it lasts for 2-3 holidays then I am not doing badly.You get one repair patch in the box. | Great for our boys // 5.0 // 6 Sept. 2013 // By

    It's roughly 5-6' long and 4-5' wide.  It's HUGE.  My niece and nephew just LOVE this toy and ask to play with it even in the winter time.  Since I live where it snows all winter and is sometimes minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, they can't play with water outside in the winter, so my nephew contents himself with playing with the boats and characters.

 on 14 May 2015 // This really is a nice toy, my son loves it.  There are lots of different play modes and many different ways the toy can be expanded so plenty of future potential too.I would say its quite an expensive product, not exactly huge value for your money but still a very good product (typical Swedish product, similar to Brio trains in many ways).  It takes a bit of time to assemble first time out of the box so make sure you have a large 5 foot square flat area and about an hour to build it (quicker on subsequent occasions as much of the initial time is in installing rubber seals).The product is definitely worth 5 stars but the one we received was missing several components.  Amazon rapidly replaced the whole product, but the second one also had components missing. | Brilliant! // 5.0 // 25 April 2014 // By

 on 12 May 2013 // My two little Grandsons age 2 & 3 enjoy playing with this Aqua set so from that perspective, good value.  However, it arrives literally in pieces, so takes a couple of hours to put together and the instructions are poor.  It is just moulded plastic on the whole with a sheet of stick on transfers.  The tip is to ensure that you put it on flat ground, any slope and the water won't flow sufficiently to move the boats around. | Aquaplay // 5.0 // 10 Aug. 2011 // By

At least two pieces missing, though we can still make something up from the pieces that were delivered.  And forget about trying to make a little suitcase out of even two of the big pieces.

 on 3 Sept. 2006 // We have had one of these pools for four summers now. It is a major attraction during the warm weather and popular from babies up to teenagers and a few adults have been tempted in as well. The soft, inflatable edge makes it incredibly safe and this summer my son and two of his friends spent a day running across the garden and launching themselves over the side and into the water! They couldn't have done this with a rigid sided pool. Once the kids are in bed, parents can get a look in, wallowing in a couple of large swim-rings with a G&T in their hand!You need a surface that's as level as you can manage because too much slope causes the water to push against the lower side and the weight could cause the pool to collapse. We have a very slight incline but the pool can cope with this. We rake the ground smooth before spreading out the pool and use a thick ground sheet underneath. We walk over this in bare feet to feel for any missed stones etc. My neighbour has a similar pool and has created a permanent surface, dug into the ground, levelled out, covered in a thick layer of fine sand and with a groundsheet over the whole area and pegged down neatly round the edges. It looks great but we seem to manage fine with our seasonal arrangement. The pool is made of strong materials and in fact we've never had a puncture or hole. You spread out the pool in situ and we invested in an electric pump to inflate the top ring which is invaluable and gets used for lots of other things too! Once the water just covers the bottom of the pool, we pull out the bottom from the edges to remove any creases. Inevitably we are left with one or two small ones...almost impossible not to, but this is the stage to get it as smooth as you can.Read more › | we're going to need a bigger boat... // 5.0 // 25 July 2007 // By

 on 25 July 2007 // I naively thought this was a big kids (or indeed adults) paddling pool. I was wrong. This is a serious bit of kit. In the title where it says 10ft diameter dimensions, it literally does mean 10ft diameter. Of course I know what 10ft looks like, but here's a tip, IMAGINE in your head what 10ft looks like, then in reality add about 50%. You will probably come close to the actual size of this thing. You don't imagine it being as big as it is! It is huge. I am soooo glad I didn't go for a bigger one.So Step 1: Get over the shock of the size of it, it will be useful to get confirmation, counselling, in depth discussion and opinion from your neighbour, wife, postman, anybody willing to listen...Step 2: Preparation. Although it is sold as a simple concept 'easy set'- beware this is not an ankle deep splash pool. This a small swimming pool! You will need a level garden, you will need a huge amount of old carpet to put down on said garden to protect from punctures, before you then lay your pool on top, and you will need to say a loving farewell to the grass underneath - you wont be seeing that again - within 10 days of installing, the grass is already as dead as a dead thing.Step 3: Installation. It is recommended you buy an electrical pump. ""Ha!"" I thought. ""I don't need an electrical pump."" 100 exhausting puffs later with little to show for it and I had a rethink... actually not quite - luckily for me my free stand bicycle pump, if you unscrewed the end, fitted the nozzle perfectly (about 2.5 cm in diameter). It's only the upper ring around the top that need pumping up, I personally think that's a waste of money for a electric pump -just don't try to do it by lung power alone. Installation time could well be extended by several hours, and you could well collapse.Read more › | Caution! // 5.0 // 1 Aug. 2005 // By

 on 1 Aug. 2005 // This pool's design requires that you set it up on an *absolutely* level AND smooth surface. The sheer weight of water will flatten the base lining over any (and all) small lumps & bumps underneath it. If any are remotely sharp then... bye bye lining.""Ready for water in 10 minutes"" Yeh, right! It took that to open the box & layout the liner. Then about another 15 mins to blow up the ring then a further 3-4 HOURS to fill it with water. Do allow a good 5 hours to set up otherwise you will have a lot of disappointed kids on your hands. My mate bought one and had to empty it again to level the ground by about 2-3"" on one side. The earth had to be covered by an old carpet to stop any little stones puncturing the liner.Once set up properly this pool is excellent value. (we paid a lot less for ours - shop around). However dispite the pump I would recommend the use of some chemical to keep the water clean. Both mine and my mate's water has gone green after only a couple of weeks.

 on 8 Dec. 2015 // I waited to review this, as I wanted to get a couple of seasons out of it and give a fair opinion.First of all, I have to say that it absolutely did not disappoint in terms of strength and quality - it is still as strong and durable as the day we bought it (we have had two seasons from it so far).I decided to purchase the Intex branded pool, as we had heard from friends that the cheaper brands just did not match up to this quality and durability-wise - I have to agree on this one!The pool comes with everything you need (pool, filter, pump, inlet and outlet hoses, fixtures and fittings, etc.) except for the pump to inflate the top ring.The electric pump can be purchased for a small price, and is well worth it.Set-up was fast and very simple! I managed to set it up alone one morning, and it took about six hours to fill (with good water pressure).I would recommend that if you do purchase this, you also purchase the easy set swimming pool cover to keep out debris (and warmth in until you are ready to use it for the day) and a groundsheet to go under the pool before you set it up, as this will help to protect the base.The filter is brilliant and very easy to connect and use, however, you do need to swish the water and bits that sink around a bit to get them up as the inlet and outlet tubes are connected quite high up. We just used a soft, clean nylon brush for this and a small long-handled fishing net to scoop bits out.I recommend that you also purchase a couple of additional pool filter liners (which are also very reasonably-priced), as you will need this throughout the season.We did choose to chlorinate our pool water, as it will last longer and not stagnate very quickly!Read more ›","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Stack 'm High Ltd"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£43.52""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""The Magic Toy Shop"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£59.73""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""CharliesDirect"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£55.95""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""MyBlueCloudShop"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£60.94""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""Splash And Relax"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£60.95""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""UK Home & Garden Store Ltd"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£62.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""BigGameHunters"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£69.50""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Rush it uk"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£74.95""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""Yachew LTD"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£83.61""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""tablet_books"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£90.99""}]}"

Like sitting on the side.Decent size too, meaning our four and five year old plus their cousin were able to enjoy time together without really getting in each other's way.The only downside to the size is that it takes some time to fill and releases a lot of water when you empty it.

 on 2 Jun. 2013 // I bought this gun for quite a cheap price, so it is most definitely worth it.  A really powerful and accurate gun which includes a twelve dart clip and this is great for nerf wars as most my other guns only hold about 6, 7, 8 bullets so I've always got more shots than anyone else in the nerf war although i don't win all the time as my dad practically never misses a shot.  It of course isn't THAT educational but it's a toy so...Powerful?  Definitely.  Accurate?  N-strike elite guns guarantee twenty metres of range and it shoots further than twenty metres but it fishtails slightly after about thirty metres but thats pretty good for a for not the biggest n-stike.

 on 11 July 2011 // We are over the moon with this pool - although I have to add that we bought an extra 18ft thermal cover to put on top of the ground sheet as the base seems a bit thin and we did not want any old twigs which we missed on the ground to rip the bottom.Up sides - easy to set up (30 mins max), seems very strong once water is in it - bit wobbly when empty.Big Down side - The intake valve for the filter is at about the 42 inch point so the pool HAS to be almost full before the filter can be used, and therefore the heater - IF you have younger children and are worried that they can't stand in deep water or and don't want to fill it to the top (because you are on a water meter) then this pool is not for you.Mini down side - you really must get a solar cover to go with it, and make sure you have a plug socket near where you want it to go as the lead is quite short.If you are in a cooler climate - I strongly recommend the Intex heater to go with it. | Great family pool // 5.0 // 20 Aug. 2012 // By

 on 20 Aug. 2012 // We have had this pool for a couple of weeks now after purchasing it from Amazon. Delivered very quickly in just a couple of days. Pool set up was relatively easy and took about an hour but filling the pool took a little longer 23 hours - much to my daughters' frustration! The pool temperature took only a few days to reach a very acceptable temperature(and is at present 23 degrees) so I don't think you need a heater even in our poor summer climate..We did purchase a solar thermal cover separately which is a must as it does keep the pool temp up.Overall a great pool easy to put up, great value and very well constructed. I would also recommend the 48in depth which is great as my kids like to spend a lot of time under water and you can't really do this in a shallower pool. Pump works really well and it comes with pretty much everything you need apart from the chemicals. | Awesome pool !! - by Elena (12yrs old) // 5.0 // 18 Jun. 2013 // By

 on 4 Sept. 2011 // Making a flat base was the hardest part of setting up of the pool. The pool itself was reasonably easy to assemble with two people. We always had two extra of the connectors and all the holes lined up making the pool set up easy as long as you followed the instructions. A good buy. We have used it every day with El nino solar panels and with an intex heater to extend the useage. Lots of fun.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""activeleisure"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£349.94""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Splash And Relax"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£379.89""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""H2OFun"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£359.98""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""PalmTreePools"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£349.99""}]}"

 on 7 Jun. 2015 // The one star review is to get your attention and has nothing to do with the functionality of this pool: it's actually great. The padded floor is a fantastic idea and the sides are good and supportive for little ones when inflated fully. My big issue here is that the second ring down, the yellow one, is absolutely plastered, all the way around, with a stupid health & safety notice in every language on the planet, and probably a few beyond, contrary to the image shown above. We ordered this pool rather than the cheaper all-blue one because we thought it looked pretty, with it being multi-coloured. The safety warning utterly ruins that. Had I bought it from a shop I could have easily returned it to for a refund I would have done so. For the value of the pool, however, I couldn't be arsed with the re-packing and returns palaver. | Fun little pool // 4.0 // 30 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 6 Sept. 2015 // Whether this is a disposable product after a season or not, this brings a lot of fun for money - even more so if you buy the pool in the wet season at 2/3 off the price for the next summer. On a hot day, you can get 4 or 5 kids together having great time for two hours at any one go. Compare and contrast with going to the cinema, your pay-back is almost instant. Even better for birthday parties if they ou are lucky with the weather.Having said that, the pool requires care and maintenance so that you don't need to change the water and clean the pool every week, which is fastidious. Buy a top, to prevent bird drops, leaves, particles in suspension and insects and ensure you cover the pool straight away after each session. Get chlorine and algaecide. And invest in a pump to as a third line of defence against algae - and mosquitoes larvae.That should last for three years.Let the children enjoy. | Million times better than bestway // 5.0 // 22 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 14 Jun. 2010 // Easy to blow up as doesn't require much air - the downside of this is that the sides are not particularly strong and water easily escapes whenever a child gets in or out. The base is very thin and was riddled with small holes after the first use. The sides are also pretty thin and the top developed a puncture after an hour or so. Overall we felt that it's just not tough enough as a pool for children - of any age. Item discarded and replaced with a tougher model. | fab // 5.0 // 11 Aug. 2013 // By

 on 11 Sept. 2015 // I was worried by how small the package was (fearing it could not be strong enough) but it has proved amazingly robust and a huge success.  It hasn't actually been used as a paddling pool because it's not been warm enough, but a 6 year old and two 4 year olds have plunged in and out of the inflated (empty) pool (being seals, lions, monkeys), bounced on the inflated sides, dragged it around the garden upside down over their heads and best of all, using it like a hamsters wheel, three small children can roll it on its side at some speed across the grass!  I wouldn't expect the maunfacturer's warranty to cover any of this, but for two grandparents looking after 3 energetic grandchildren for 5 days in disappointing weather, it has certainly been excellent value.  Hopefully it will be warm enough to actually put water in it next summer. | SO GOOD AND IT IS BIGGER THAN YOU THINK // 5.0 // 5 Feb. 2014 // By

 on 14 May 2010 // Purchased as a present for a very active little boy, this is a great paddling pool and looks like it is one that really will stand test of time. The inflatable base is brilliant for small children and adults! Nice to have something a little more comfortable to sit on.The wall panels are both attractive and very sturdy. Nice to have a pool that won't spill water everywhere each time a child launches themselves out of the pool on their stomach! As someone who hates soggy lawns or wet slippery patios thanks to pools sloshing water everywhere, this feature is really important to me. The shape is not just a nice alternative design feature. It seems to add some decent structure to the pool and holds the shape well despite very rough play when there are 4 children jumping in and out.Thanks to relatively cool weather, this pool has been used as a ball pit so far and the sides are high enough that this option also works well. While there is not a canopy like many, don't let that put you off. Slides and swings don't have canopies either! Just position it in the shade or with an umberella. I have had collapsing canopy pools and ones with roofs and they are a hassle to keep inflated properly as well as dry out and stop mould. Never again!All in all, worth the extra money. I know you can purchase a pool at a fraction of the cost - and I have done so many times. However, this is not your average ""dispose after a half season"" pool. Made of nice thick plastic, this should last a lot longer than one season - more environmentally friendly option and should even save money in the long term.In fact, I think I will order a second one for my own children. | Just the job for our small garden. // 5.0 // 19 Aug. 2013 // By

 on 28 July 2014 // This on really is great fun - with a little practice, it really will fly far. If thrown just above the surface, it can start by surface skipping around 5 meters. Under water the powered throw will probably be less, but its weight allows it to still go quite far, and in any case it ends in a gliding sink which extends the reach depending on the depth of the pool. This also mean that you have to either be really quick, or dive after it (which the kids love too)On the other hand, the fact that it does sink, may mean that this toy is less suited for the beach. And less suited for kids who won't/can't dive (unless in a very shallow pool). | Hours of fun in the pool! // 5.0 // 27 Mar. 2013 // By

We devised a game which involved launching it along the surface of the pool waiting 5 seconds and then trying to get it before it sunk to the bottom (""detonated!""). Once caught you had to get it to the side of the pool and then you needed to get below the surface to stop it activating it's ""motion trigger"".  The points system was based on how long you stayed under after recovering it to the side. 1 point for 10 seconds, 2 points for 20 etc...Was great fun.

I lost my older Toypedo and replaced it with this new one. But have found it doesn't seem to glide as far or travel as fast as the older one. Plus when its finished gliding it seems to hang in the water before sinking which is good for less able swimmers but not as challenging for more able swimmer. Still a good design an has some plus.

It is easy to use and the boys were able to inflate the boat before they got bored of pumping (which doesn't normally take very long). Would certainly recommend it. | So quick and easy to use. // 4.0 // 1 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 13 Aug. 2013 // This is a great, sturdy pool.It inflates in three separate sections, so if you have a little one, you can choose not to inflate the top section so that they can get in and out more easily.  Inflates in about 1 minute per section with a decent electric pump and has plugs to stop the air escaping straight after you unplug the pump.It has a drainage hole in the bottom of the pool so that when you come to empty it you can just pull the plug out and let it drain rather than having to scoop the water out or tip it up - which would be impossible considering its weight when filled with water.We have a water meter and estimate that it costs us around £1 to fill it pool as we never fully fill it anyway.  The size that they state for the dimensions are the outside of the pool.  MY boyfriend is over 6ft tall though, and he can lie down in it fully with his arms out so it has a substantial inner size.As suggestions - we also bought the INTEX cover from a different amazon seller.  It fits easily over the pool.  I was a little worried that it would have no overhang as they state that the cover is the same size as the pool but this is not the case.  This will save us having to empty and re-fill it every time we want to use it.Also, we'd recommend that you put something under the pool (an old piece of carpet, a large flat cardboard box etc,) as the ""floor"" of the pool is just a thin film so you do feel any bumps underneath it.Overall, really happy with this purchase and the seller was very helpful. | Ok but not the best. // 3.0 // 18 July 2013 // By

 on 16 Sept. 2014 // My 9 year old daughter loves pink dresses, pigtails, puppies, kittens, makeup and... Nerf guns.  She loves shooting things, (tranquilising stuffed animals to take to the pretend vets, balloons, Nerf target, her Dad), and now has several Rebelle (girly Nerf) toys.  This one is probably the most fun.  The magazine holds 12 Nerf darts (supplied) and they can be fired off one at a time whenever you want, or very quickly almost like a machine gun.  It's easy to reload the magazine too.  Be warned though, it needs four AA batteries, but they seem to be lasting quite well so far.The main unit feels quite sturdy but I imagine that the dart magazine could be easily cracked / broken if you're not carefull.  For this reason I wouldn't recommend spending £20+ on it.  Shop around for a lower price. | Great Gun // 5.0 // 22 Oct. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 22 Oct. 2014 // For my grandchildren this is the third Neuf Rebelle product after the ‘Heartbreaker’ and ‘Agent’ bows, and it takes the form of a gun that shoots darts.  It is ‘motorized’ and requires 4 AA batteries (not included) to supply ‘blasting’ power for its 12 darts with 6 plain and 6 with coded messages that all fit into the girly pink magazine.  There is a decoder that is somewhat gimmicky but a sliding panel on the packaging shows how messages may be read (some foreign!).  Forget this - it is fire-power that matters and the ‘Neuf Rebelle Rapid Blaster’ has it in spades!  It is more powerful than previous bows with a range up to 20 yards or so, and with enough ‘wellie’ to knock over light unfixed targets.  The gun sights well and it can shoot singularly as for a sniper or it can shoot speedily like a machine gun - so what else?  As a granddad I don’t really understand the popularity of the Neuf products marketed for girls - but I acknowledge this ‘Neuf Rebelle Rapid Blaster’ as a 5-star product. | A cool toy for girls who don't want more dolls. // 4.0 // 29 Oct. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 29 Oct. 2014 // Now this is a present for my niece, but I had to try it out :)It requires 4 AA batteries (not included) so make sure you have them ready for us.You load the ""darts"" into the magazine, and then there are 2 triggers to pull. The first in the handle you pull to activate the power, and then you have the main trigger to fire the darts. The gun does make a whirring noise when you pull the power trigger, but don't worry about it as it isn't too distracting and holding the power trigger is easy.The darts do fly a good distance and they are pretty accurate, I set up some empty coke tins to test this out. They are nice and soft, so while they do fly well and hit the target, you will not have worry about injuries. The design of the gun is quite nice as well, not too pink but still having that essence that it is designed for girls instead of boys.Only negative is the weight and the fact it uses 4 batteries in the nose of the gun which makes it slightly nose heavy, but not sure how you get around that.

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 24 Oct. 2014 // Great Nerf, design is aimed at the girls rather than the boys, lilac and purple which are a nice combination.The Nerf itself works brilliantly, shots fly across the room at some speed, and there is no excuse for not knowing who just got you as the darts are also a pink and blue.Easy to load and light weight make it a very nice weapon to carry, a lot of thought has gone in to Nerf, made for a target audience that is sure to love the colour and size. | a girl themed nerf gun // 4.0 // 20 Oct. 2014 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 20 Oct. 2014 // It's a nerf gun, in pink, designed for girls. It fires out single shots from a 12 bullet clip. Takes 4 AA batteries. The secret message gimmick is just that, a gimmick, and pretty pointless. No real special features otherwise to make this anything other than a bog standard nerf gun, except that it's pink!!

 on 25 Dec. 2014 // Bought Xmas 2014. We had bought several other Nerf guns and water pistols before, all had a reasonable build quality and all had worked well so I had no hesitation to buy this one. Unfortunately, the one which I had received was not of a great quality. The first bullet in the magazine is not presented correctly in the breech, every time you change the magazine you need to lift the breech cover and fumble around trying to push the bullet into the correct position. Even if you get it firing, there is a high probability of blockage after 3 or 4 shots. Some shots do not fire correctly and just fall out of the end of the gun.Also the breech cover needs to be closed correctly for the gun to fire. Unfortunately, it doesn't close correctly. A male adult hand is big enough to hold the gun and push down the breech cover at the same time - an eight year old girl's hand is not big enough.When you do manage to get it to fire correctly, it is pretty accurate though.It requires 4 x AA batteries. Rechargeables have a voltage of 1.2 V, whereas the ordinary, one use batteries provide 1.5V. It doesn't seem to work well on rechargeables. | Great fun at a great price // 5.0 // 16 Nov. 2014 // By

I agree with the other reviewers that the secret message gimmick is pointless, as mentioned it would be better for the other team to read them, not the 'sender'.

 on 27 Dec. 2014 // Apart from some minor gripes, it's absolutely perfect and my nephew loved it to bits. If you've got the space, it's a really excellent toy.Assembly is a little difficult, and really I don't think a child could put it together very readily. It took three adults half an hour to assemble it out of the box and there was a lot of humming and hawing and ""Am I doing this right?"" moments. The joints don't really click together, and you often have to brute force things. Despite this, nothing broke, and the joints were all watertight (although my nephew quickly managed to splash water everywhere. No real surprises there). Once assembled it was sturdy and we were able to move it with no bother.The other wee problem was the boats that come with it, which I think are just kind of naff. Some of them aren't watertight, so wind up filling up with water, making them totally useless. In general they're just a bit too big and fat. The canals themselves are massive, and you could scoot decent sized boat toys around them no problem, but the ones that come with it are just a little unwieldy. Not holding this against it, though, because it's easy to get- or make- other boats to put into it. What you're buying here is the canals, and they're beyond reproach.I looked through a few Big Waterplay sets before finding this one, and it seems to be the only one with a lock/pump/slide mechanism. This is the best part- allowing your child to raise boats up with the pump, then send them down the slide on a torrent of water. It's great fun and a very cool mechanical lesson too. I was a little dubious as to whether it would all work at first, but it works a charm. The pump, the watertight gates and the lock all work.Read more › | Great value lots of fun // 5.0 // 19 Aug. 2013 // By

 on 19 Aug. 2013 // Great value, good quality. 3 different layouts are possible.  No probs with leaks,  Obviously gets bit splashy.  Great fun re the process of getting the boats moving ( or blocked if you decide one boat is a villain's!) and lots of scope for imaginative play.  Small kids from around 2 would get a big kick out of it and plenty of pleasure to be gained from it I'm guessing for up to 9 or 10 if bigger siblings.  My 6 yr old girl loves it and so do I her 43 yr old mother.  Am sure Dad will too,  Good price compared to others on market.  Prompt delivery.

 on 31 July 2013 // My 7 year old boy LOVES this toy, and I knew he would. I am so impressed with the price and the quality of it. The plastic is not cheap or flimsy but robust and pretty thick. The rubber seals around the joints work a treat. The selection of water vehicles is interesting and fun and I love that you can turn the handle on one of the pop-in bits and create a current to send the boats round the canals. It is possible to play with this toy alone, all you do is sit near the pump and move the pop-in current maker to one of the closer sections of canal. We have lego divers swimming around and the odd matchbox car dropping in for a swim just to add to the fun.

 on 8 July 2013 // We really liked the look of this paddling pool & it looked like it fitted the bill with a good rating.  I never buy products with a poor rating & always read the reviews so I thought we were on to a winner with this product.  It was fantastic on the 1st day and our 3.5 year boy and his friends had great fun playing in and around it.  We then put it away carefully but the next time we used it was full of holes and the air came out of it as fast as you tried to pump it up!  Such a great idea but steer clear- it will just cause a great deal of disappointment and it's hard to explain to a little boy that he can't play in his pirate ship :( | great fun // 5.0 // 19 July 2013 // By

The mast with the flag on doesn't stand up straight but tends to be at about 45 degrees.

 on 15 Aug. 2013 // Firstly, let me say how big the Rainbow Ring Play Centre is.........HUGE!!!!  Not a bad thing though as if you have very young kids, there is plenty of space in either of the pools to get in with them for supervision.  For older kids, there should be enough room for a good few of them to get in without contention tantrums. :)The material and seams appear to be very durable, having had to drag this around the garden a few times to reposition it.  The shower nozzle is a fun feature and has an adapter to fit a Hozelock-equipped hose, but beware....the shower nozzle needs securing or it thrashes about under the hose water pressure and soaks more than the pool occupants!The biggest feature (literally) is also the biggest drawback; the size.  There are multiple chambers to inflate and to do them all took quite a long time even with an electric pump......I really wouldn't recommend trying to blow this up manually, not unless you have a spare pair of lungs ready for transplant afterwards.  It won't be easy to store once inflated either, so be prepared to leave it on the lawn or deflate/reinflate it every time.That said, it can't be marked down for that, so 5 stars it is! | Brilliant // 5.0 // 18 July 2014 // By

 on 29 July 2013 // The only positive thing about this product is the timely delivery, for which you pay big money. Instructions are insufficient. I spent several hours trying to inflate this monster using the electric pump I bought especially for this product. It is a lot of fun when kids are all ready to get in and you cannot move it once it is inflated. Try to find pump long enough so as the monster is more than 2 meters away from any structure (as required by the product). Well, after spending 3 hours inflating (I took breaks) it looked ready. We filled it with water. We did not even finished when we realized the monster deflates!!! I checked all the valves - they were closed. I did not find any hole, but there must be something somewhere that makes the air disappear from the main (bottom) ring. Now I have to sort the return, pay for it (on top of the money for the delivery and money for the pump). STAY AWAY!! | cool pool // 5.0 // 11 May 2014 // By

 on 20 Mar. 2014 // I've had this item on my wish list for a while as I knew my son would love it in the summer but the price was a little high.Eventually it can down to under £20 so I bought it. It arrived quickly and I got it out excited to see it but also to check the size as some people said it was smaller then they thought. I then looked at options to blow it up and it is a wide hole for the body and a small water wings style for the tail. Now unless you have the lung capacity of a blue whale I suggest buying a pump.I ordered the one suggested and this takes about 5 minutes to blow up each section. When done it really is a great piece of kit and enough room for 2 toddles with plenty for maybe a third. My son loved it and was playing in it despite the lack of water.A must in summer and good quality with the added shade of the tail. | Buy it! // 5.0 // 24 Oct. 2010 // By

 on 24 Oct. 2010 // I brought this for my daughter when she was about 8 months old and it was a good depth for her to sit in (assisted of course!) then as she grew the pool got more and more use.  On really hot days it is ideal to put the whale's jet on and kids can run through it and the whale's tail acts as an excellent shelter in the hot sun.  We had hours of fun with this pool and it doesn't take long to fill up! | Pool // 5.0 // 13 Dec. 2013 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 23 Aug. 2015 // I purchased this pool on a whim as it was in a flash sale and I could not leave it for the price! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was so pleased when it arrived.Due to the awful summer we are experiencing, I have only used it twice but we had hours of family fun with it. The pool can comfortably fit 3 babies/young toddlers with a little room to spare. My son is now 20 months and can stretch out and still have another length before he reaches the other side. You will need a pump to blow the pool up, there are 2 sections which take a few minutes to inflate. I purchased Milestone Camping AC240V/140W AC Electric Air Pump inflator/deflator for airbeds paddling pools & toys. Universal valves. 3 pin UK plug. Black which did the job nicely. The tails offer a little shade when positioned correctly, when connected to the hose it sprays water which is a welcome feature on a hot day.The pool has impressed both friends and family and I will use this pool for summers to come.I highly recommend. Hope this review was helpful. | Whale pool spray // 5.0 // 19 Aug. 2013 // By

 on 19 Aug. 2013 // Bought this for a family party where we had two small children coming, they had a great time, the spray worked well so all in all an excellent purchase. The pool is quite robust so lived up to expectation. Fortunately we had an electric pump to blow it up as it is quite big.

 on 16 Aug. 2013 // Smaller than I imagined, and the tail comes quite a way over the pool area, not a great problem, but the whale pool I bought some years ago was better.

 on 30 Sept. 2015 // Funky retro design at a bargain price, my son can't wait to pack them in to loot bags for his party guests. The only issue I have is that they are packaged in sheets of six but I was expecting  them to be packaged individually as the image above suggest. I am planning to give 2 per guest but will have to separate them which is a bit inconvenient. If it was made clear in the product description, I would have purchased more to give each guest a set each. | A great little party activity // 5.0 // 18 Feb. 2016 // By

 on 18 Feb. 2016 // I always buy tattoos like this for my children's parties as it is a great extra little activity that doesn't come with a high cost.  These tattoos are really easy to apply unlike some I have previously purchased which take a lot of effort and time to get them to come off of the backing paper in one piece.  These are so easy to use that some of the children (5 years old) were able to put them on themselves with very little help.  Most of the time they come off very easily (especially when they are on hands) however I have found that when they are placed on an area where they don't get rubbed by clothing they can be a bit stubborn to remove.  When this happens using baby oil on a cotton pad helps to remove it. | good for the price // 5.0 // 18 Sept. 2014 // By

 on 26 Aug. 2015 // Got these for my children. Some of the tattoos are off centred so When you separate them from each other you lose part of the tattoo. Was a little disappointed even though I didn't expect them to be perfect as they were so cheap. This may have been a printing mistake.

 on 4 Dec. 2014 // This is great fun, we have sphero 2.0 and lots of other RC toys / robots. When I say we I mean the little ones but I think I have just as much fun with Sphero as they do. It's much faster then sphero and is closer to an RC car than to Sphero 2.0. Control via your smartphone running iOS or Andriod is very responsive and the app is very good. I love how you can customise it with different tyres depending on terrain (obviously at extra cost so typical marketing) but it allows that personal touch. Build quality is excellent as with Sphero 2.0 and is very durable so can take jumps etc without breaking.

 on 11 Dec. 2014 // I would be interested to see if this review is published as this item (Robo Sapien X) is the shoddiest item I have ever bought from Amazon. I have taken delivery of two of these and have yet to be sent one that actually works let alone perform all the marvellous tricks it's supposed to do.  I am no space scientist but I have an engineering background and would consider myself generally competent.  I lost the first hour gingerly unpacking the robot, digesting the manual and double-checking while the robot blinked aimlessly but did nothing else.  After another hour spent changing the batteries and checking online for meaningful advice I contacted Amazon and arranged a replacement.  As you can guess, this involved repackaging the toy and trailing down to the Post Office.  After a week I received a replacement which lo and behold was completely lifeless.There is nothing to suggest this toy has been subject to any form of testing or quality control.  I refuse to believe that this experience is unique to me and that the sellers are unaware of the problems.  Do not reply to me asking if I have used reputable/fresh batteries and are they in the right way round.This item should work OUT OF THE BOX FIRST TIME.

 on 4 Jan. 2014 // Do yourselves a favour and disregard the ""other"" bad review.  This series are nice starter slot car sets from one of the oldest (if not the oldest) manufacturers.The pieces DO fit together unless your hands consist of 4  thumbs and 1  finger each. Tie clips are provided so that the pieces stay together.  The supports are a little unstable but the track is not meant to be nudged about.  The cars do fly off IF YOU DO NOT DRIVE THEM!!!  ie if you do not control the throttle!!  If you go flat out all the time the cars will go off the much like a real car would. So there is a degree of difficulty, and I would say the minimum age is about 6 years (for an average kid.)Much better toy for a six year old boy than all that other stuff floating around. | Exactly what we wanted for a Christmas present.

They both sat and put it together on Boxing day, even my 4 year old put some pieces together when his brother showed him where they went, they had a great time.However obviously my 4 year old wants to play with it, but as I have read before it does fall apart easily and as he doesn't know where the parts go he has to hassle his older brother to put it back together and I think he's now getting fed up.So to build was great, to play with not so much.

It's a great toy for building all things small and large, and this Buzz Lightyear is definitely large!The detail is fantastic, (he only has half a helmet though, there is no bit folded inside), it comes with plenty of pieces, an would take an amateur about 30mins to build by following the instructions. It's a fantastic copy of the actual Buzz Lightyear.The wings can be folded away, and his head, arms and legs can all be moved. The playability factor for a child would be extremely high (bar the fact of LEGO regularly falling apart with too much use!).Overall: Fan of Toy Story? Fan of LEGO?

 on 5 May 2011 // Well, I've been playing Magic: The Gathering for a few years now, but I've never been particularly serious about it. I remember from my early days, though, that a friend of mine had a ""Sliver"" deck which was feared by everybody else in our gaming circle. After a couple of years without touching it, I picked the game back up, and immediately thought back to that friend.Slivers are strange, snake-like creatures with sharp beaks and claws, and they work in a fascinating way. Every Sliver has a unique ability, which is given to any other Sliver creature in play. This means that what one Sliver can do, all of them can.In terms of gameplay, this lets you defeat an ill-prepared opponent in a few moves due to the unexpected swarming effect. After testing the deck (Straight from the box with no alterations made to the deck composition) against a few friends, I learned that it is only effective as-is against people who haven't customised and specialised their own decks.If you want to use this deck fiercely and competitively, I don't recommend using it straight out of the packet, and instead really advise you pick and mix your cards, swapping a few of the less useful ones out for cards you consider more valuable. If you're looking for a less intense and more dramatic game with other casually inclined friends, you can use it as it comes. Either way, you'll get your money's worth.Now, moving away from the gameplay aspect, the product itself is fantastically presented. It comes with a 20-sided dice which can (And I imagine is supposed to) be used as a life counter, but I've also been using it in roleplaying games.

 on 8 Feb. 2013 // There are a lot of cards that are really necessary, but kind of difficult to get. For the more experienced player, this Starter Deck contains a LOT of brilliant cards.For the experienced players:Number 39 Utopia is (probably) the most-used Xyz card in current meta decks. It's very easy to summon, and the effects are absolutely brilliant.Alexandrite Dragon is a nice beatdown card, and can work well in a variety of decks, particularly if you're running Rescue Rabbit. With 2000 ATK for a level 4 it's pretty sweet.Cyber Dragon is pretty self-explanatory. Everyone wants Cyber Dragon. EVERYONE.Swords of Revealing Light is a sought-after card, especially for burn/lockdown decks.I've also seen Maestroke, The Symphony Djinn used a fair bit.For the beginners:This deck is a BRILLIANT starting point for Yu-Gi-Oh!. Although the combos aren't particularly advanced, they ARE effective - don't be under any illusions, this will crash and burn against a meta (powerful) deck, but it's great fun to use. You'll want to either buy or build a stronger deck with more powerful and thought-out combos once you start entering tournaments, though.5/5, great product. | great deck!!! // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2012 // By

I didn't get anything to spectacular all I got was a rare reverse and a holo (Rare reverse:Floatzel) (Holo:Milotic). But I was a bit sad that there was no plasma freeze pack but it doesn't matter! All I need now is the chesnaught tin! This tin is also great for storage. If you want to know what packs there is then read on: 1 plasma blast, 1 XY , and 2 flash fire packs.

 on 30 Dec. 2015 // This product is of very little, if any, use to serious MTG players. However, if you are a casual player and collector like me, then I believe you are going to enjoy this product.In terms of playability, a lot of people in the comments section here claim that the blue deck is overall more powerful than the red deck, but this is untrue in my opinion. From my experience, after playing a series of games with both decks, me and my friend have concluded that the red deck just appears to be dominant due to its strong early performance. Whatever people think, there is clearly an imbalance in this duel set. Be it as it may, the product will deliver some enjoyment to you and a friend.In terms of pricing this product disappoints me a little. The priciest card on this set at the time of this review is Krenko, Mob Boss, according to trolltradercards,com at the price of ~£3.12. The rest of the cards have very little value. This tells me that you would be able to replicate these decks by buying the individual cards for an overall incredibly reduced price. I suspect that it would be a lot more worth it buying the box and leaving it sealed for collection. It could potentially become a lot more expensive as did the Goblins Vs Elves Duel Decks. Other than that I see no other reason to buy this set, unless you are feeling lazy and don't feel like going through all the trouble of buying the individual cards. | fun decks some interesting cards needs a spot of tinkering ... // 5.0 // 19 Jan. 2015 // By

The head is not at all heavy but visibility isn't the best and can be a little loose but apart from that, excellent! | Good Value // 4.0 // 6 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 6 Dec. 2013 // I haven't given this product 5 stars as the only problem with it is the face is front heavy! So it does slip forward if you intend to jump around in it. We just added some Velcro to the back of the neck and the back of the suit. We found this worked really well. The product was delivered when promised and I think the quality of the outfit is very good for the price. | Fancy dress // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 4 April 2010 // I bought this outfit for a fancy dress party and I was really impressed by the quality to the dress - heavy velvet, well cut and stitched.  I got many favourable comments.  It fitted well.  Was a little long for me (I'm 5' 3"") but I didn't want to cut it as there is gold braid round the bottom so I just let it trail a little - very mediaeval. | Medieval Night out // 5.0 // 13 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 13 Jan. 2014 // I wore this when I spent a few days in a castle where a medieval banquet was held.  I chose the Large size as I am a size 14-16 and hover between the two.  It fitted really well and there are ties at the back to take up the slack!  The material is better than I expected and as I had to  iron it before I wore it, was a bit anxious as to whether it  would stand up to it, but it did!  The headdress took a bit of sorting out but once I had worked it out how to put it on it was very effective and looked the part.  Great value for money. I received many compliments and I recommended it to many people at the banquet. | Great price for a great costume // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2011 // By

 on 27 Dec. 2011 // I had been looking at used costumes but was able to buy this costume new at a cheaper price than I could get the used costumes for. The headdress comes up a little small but looks good. I am usually a size 12-14 but went for the 16-18 and am glad I did as this size fits better on a larger chest. The back of the waist is elasticated and there is a tie on each side of the costume so it can be adjusted to make the fit tighter. The material is very nice and doesn't look cheap. Very pleased with the item and it looks like it should cost a lot more than it actually did. | maid marion costume // 5.0 // 24 Nov. 2012 // By

 on 18 Jun. 2015 // It's ok for a silly dress up party, but would not be suitable for a more formal occasion, such as a medieval themed ball or banquet, for example. There seem to be some issues with length, according to other reviews, so to try and help explain: I am 5foot 6 and without shoes the dress touches the floor, exactly as on the model in the picture shown here. There isn't actually a pink underskirt, as the picture seems to imply - the pink material is simply a triangular panel that has been sown into the front. Similarly, the border across the hip does not actually go all around the dress, same with the border around the neckline - it does not continue around the back. This makes the dress pretty boring and unflattering to look at from behind, as it's basically just one huge sack of crushed velveteen material when looked at from the back. The finishing is ok, I had to cut off various threads that were still hanging off the seams, but nothing too drastic. The headpiece does fit me ok, but from experience when buying hats, my head does seem to be on the small side. However the bits of veil that are supposed to come down by the side of the face are smaller than in the picture shown, which makes them look quite silly. Plus, I think the model is actually wearing the headpiece incorrectly, as it contains more veil (not visible in the picture)  that I think goes around the neck and chin (Google 'Medieval Headdress' and you'll see what I mean.) It looks ok when this veil part is worn around the front of the neck, but it still doesn't change the fact that the bits on the side of the face are too short. | Amazing costume! // 4.0 // 15 Feb. 2013 // By

The fabric is sewn together well and a nice fit - clothes such as leggins and t-shirt can be worn beneath without spoiling appearance. The costume is ideal for 'World Book Day' and does not reveal too mush flesh.

Stiffening in puffs at top of sleeve to keep shape, I added knee length chiffon split over-sleeves for more authenticity and used braid from headdress to hide the join. Quite thin black 'velvet' fabric. 'Brocade' is more pinky red than bright red, a silky plain fabric with all over pattern of tiny silver dots. Snug fit on 39"" bust.

The material is quite thin, but it's nice and fleecy, and if you want the edges have poppers that you can use to make sleeves. There is also a popper at the front to keep the front closed. The hood is a good size, and the ears are sturdy enough that if you balance them right they will stand up instead of just flopping over. Customer service was also very good.

The silvery trousers were snagged in many places, no belt came with it & the sleeves again we're very frayed.Very poor quality- my son wore it to school ( too late to change) & cape button came off when he tried to take the chain off.Given the cost it's very poor quality | Lots Of Fun // 5.0 // 2 Dec. 2011 // By

 on 11 Sept. 2013 // This is a great kit for the money. It is a 1970's mould but the parts fit together well and to the usual high standard you expect from Tamiya. Has made me hungry for a more advanced model in their 1:35 tanks series!My only criticism is that wit the exception of the miniature crew, there are no paint instructions. This was strange but i used tamiya acrylic dark yellow and green which has given a good likeness to the box picture. | Good value and fun to build // 5.0 // 31 July 2012 // By

 on 31 July 2012 // I bought this from buyforlessonline at a great price with free delivery, this is an old tamiya kit but i think it is a good one, you get a lot for your money, the quality is spot on, the instructions are excellent and easy to follow and you will end up with a great model. Its a bit limited for the serious modeller, but is a good base if you want to customize. Could have done with more info on the tank and some unit details too but these are minor complaints considering the price of this kit. Overall an excellent kit that is fun and straightforward to build and great value for money. | Love this model // 5.0 // 31 Oct. 2013 // By

 on 22 May 2015 // Bought this as it's cheap and I wanted something to practise and make mistakes on during an Airbrushing Course I recently attended. This is an old kit and there are better (more expensive, more parts, more complicated) Panther models out there. This wouldn't necessarily suit the more experienced modellers, however it's ideal for the beginner, it has relatively few parts, goes together well and builds up fairly easily into a reasonable replica of a Panther. The instructions for applying decals and the various paint options aren't particularly clear so depending on how keen you are on accuracy you can either copy the box art or do a little research, an enjoyable build. | Quality Mouldings and Detail , An Attractive Price . // 5.0 // 10 Oct. 2014 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 10 Oct. 2014 // One of Tamiya's older 1/35 scale AFV offerings but none the worse for that . Comes with a very attractive price tag compared to much of the Tamiya range but offers all the quality of moulding and detail that is a hallmark of Tamiya kits . Makes up into an attractive model straight from the box . Its modest price means , however , that experienced modellers may wish to indulge themselves with etched brass detailing , a turned brass gun barrel and individual track links for something of truly exhibition quality .

 on 3 Feb. 2013 // This makes up into quite an acceptable Panther if you ignore the technical inaccuracies and lack of fine detail.Perfect for younger modellers and people who aren't too bothered about the aforementioned inaccuracies.Bearing in mind that a top-end model of a 1:35 Panther will set you back at least three times this price, I, for one, can forgive its problems.It's a really old kit now (I remember building one of these in the seventies which shows it's age) and it was originally issued as a motorised model. In in fact the the lower hull still has the battery cradle moulded in and the hole for the on off switch. However, the parts are still crisply moulded and fit together very well. The only real problem is fitting the upper hull to the lower where you are left with a gap along the front edge.Highly recommended at this price.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Sales@gmm"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£14.33""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Hair Skin Beauty"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£14.34""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""jadlamracingmodels"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£14.43""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""J-Groove - Ships directly from Japan -"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£10.93""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""Buy-For-Less-Online"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£14.79""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""TOY SHOP JAPAN HOBBYONE."", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£15.12""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""Tiger Hobbies Limited"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£16.00""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Must japan"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£16.29""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""HobbiesLtd"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£16.36""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""japanstore,"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£16.40""}]}"

This builds into an impressive model of the infamous Tiger tank and in this scale it certainly does give you an impression of the impressive strength and power this awesome vehicle did project.Detail may be slightly lacking when compared to Tamiyas but only very slightly, the mouldings are crisp and more than accurate enough for someone who is not an absolute detail head.I have been building models for over 40 years and and have lost count on how many Tigers I have built in that period of time butas one reviewer here has already asked, would I buy another one?

 on 6 Dec. 2015 // Great product as usual from Tamiya, wheels and track both articulate (provided you glued them properly), as well as the rear door hatch has articulating hinges. Price is well worth it, and it would make a good starter kit (provided you have the tools and glue required), although I'd argue any Tamiya 1/35 ground vehicle (not aircraft, they have less leniency with fit) would make a good starting point.Just a tip, there are some blank square pieces of plastic that come that aren't used for anything. You can use them as bases for the infantry soldiers to stop them from tipping over so easily, and can be adorned with fake grass, spare ammo cans, etc. Or you can just use some blue tac in order to fix them in place and prevent them from falling, which is what I did with the soldier climbing over the half-track's sidewall, as he was a little bit unbalanced (probably how I glued his arms, slightly the wrong angle), but a dab of blue tac has kept him in the same place for months now. | Hanomag Sd kfz 251/1 // 5.0 // 10 Jun. 2014 // By

The mask is white plastic painted black, but only on the front, so the white plastic is still visible.  I'll need to paint the rest black so this doesn't show.  OK for the purpose I want it for but not strong enough for a child's continued use. After reading other reviews I was expecting this but not the white plastic.

 on 7 Nov. 2014 // I ordered two sets for my daughter's birthday party bags, and initially two of panda masks were missing. This was rectified quite quickly once I contacted the seller.  Then, we realised two giraffe masks didn't have elastic bands attached to them (one of them was missing some facial features as well).  To be fair, when I contacted the seller again, they told me to send the faulty items back to them (with the receipt of postage) which will then be exchanged.  This was too closer to the party, and in the end, we had enough masks for the party, so I didn't bother - it required some packaging & visit to the post office, which wasn't very convenient at the time. The quality of the masks is OK, but I just wish they paid more attention when they sent them in the first place. | Elastic breaks // 3.0 // 14 May 2011 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWER on 10 Dec. 2012 // I bought these for my two little home-educated relations, who have their own little theatre at home and who love to dress up. The masks are fun to play with although, as has been mentioned, the foam is fairly flimsy and that does mean that the elastic does tear through the holes eventually. My two little friends like to rattle through the different animal impersonations like Tommy Cooper does with the characters in his hat sketch, and that does mean that the wear and tear can be quite substantial. Things get even worse when a grown-up or big head of some other kind becomes embroiled in their production as the strain on both sides of the mask can reach critical levels.We found that a perfectly reasonable way around all that was to stick a pencil to the back of each mask. That way, the children can perform their quick changes without let or hindrance and us adults can let rip with our own impersonations of Johnny Morris. My elephant sounds like Frank Bruno, my mouse like David Beckham. My cat, for some strange reason, sounds like George Galloway. Odd.... | kids seems to like it // 4.0 // 4 Nov. 2011 // By

 on 12 May 2011 // I got these for my son and he quickly managed to break one by just putting it on.  They are made out of very thin craft foam and this just isn't strong enough to take the stress from the elastic.  They look great and I guess you get what you pay for.

Size is suitable for 3 years up, but the material itself is suitable even for babies as there are no small choking hazards on the mask, it's all made of foam pieces and elastic band. The only negative point is that the monkey's face is beige and turquoise and I've never seen a turquoise monkey.

 on 19 Jun. 2015 // This mask is highly detailed and movie accurate, reminiscent of the movie - V for Vendetta. The density and thickness of the mask came as an acquainted surprise as the material appears ever more solid and structurally sound than I had originally assumed. The mask has thick, durable straps and clips attached to the sides via metal pins and can be readjusted to fit. The package addressed to my location WAS addressed to me, yet another's name suited the box. However, that's a forgivable technicality in my eyes due to the underlaying quality of the product. The measurements are smaller than I had insinuated yet remain a decent (adult) size. However, I can merely drop the measurable notion to fiction as I had not read the measurements given by the seller.My only one complaint is within the protective foam layer that was/is presumed to be attached to the mask before application. This layer was not attached to the mask upon purchase or unboxing despite coming with the mask, but this can simply be applied to the mask by the customer at any point.Overall the mask is a keeper, an eye catcher and 100% movie accurate for those looking for more precision. The quality and structure are sound and the paintwork only captures that quality ever so more. For that, this masks receives a 5/5. | This is a really good product.

 on 31 Mar. 2015 // This is a another great toy from Fisher Price. This ogre is just over 25cm (10 inches) tall. At the bottom of the ogre's foot there is a human shaped indent into which an Imaginext figure can be pushed into giving the impression the ogre has stamped on his enemy. On the ogre's back is a handle with a trigger which if squeezed will make the ogre raise both his arms and roar/moan. This ogre can interact with the Fisher Price Imaginext Castle, if you pull the trigger anywhere near the castle a knight's voice will shout ""ogre, is that all you've got"" and ""he's in a bad mood"". For the sound effects to work this ogre requires 2 AAA batteries which have so far lasted over 2 months. This toy is robust and has taken a beating from my 6 year old and my 3 year old.

 on 18 April 2015 // I bought this set at Cardiff castle and it is brilliant! 2 red horses, 4 red men, 2 blue horses, 4 blue men - perfect for 2 little boys to play with. Some of the pieces (shields, axes etc) can come out of the figures' hands and we've already lost and found one axe and one man! 2 horses (1 red, 1 blue) can be either in a normal running position or will stand up on their back legs without being held (due to the genius design of the Cape thing covering their backs). The little men all stand up by themselves or can ride on the horses - little details like that make for a really fun toy! I really think this is an excellent set! I know it's a bit pricey, but it does seem high quality and very well designed.Our boys (5 and 2) had had loads of fun playing with the bigger Papo figures on display in the castle's cafe so I was a bit worried they'd be slightly disappointed with the smaller version. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the size didn't seem to make any difference to them! They're also the perfect size to go with our boys' bucket and spade set for the beach. Sand castles, Knights and horses - how much fun is that!? We also travel a lot so small is good in that respect. Always good to have a few toys up your sleeves... And these fit perfectly. I highly recommend them! | Nice bright colours // 3.0 // 4 May 2015 // By

 on 5 April 2005 // I have been waiting many years (since I first saw the films!!)for an accurate model of the Back To The Future DeLorean to become available in the U.K. and this offering from Sunstar does not disappoint. I had already bought the part 3 version in a high street retailer but couldn't find the first two anywhere until I looked on Amazon. The model is very detailed right down to even the time and date readout inside the car! It has a lovely brushed metal finish and is a good size (1:18)unlike other versions that have also appeared (1:24's 1:48'setc)On this model there is a button underneath which will make the car 'fly' (push wheels up) Comes in an attractive box (I havent taken mine out!) The only concern I had when ordering was how it would be packaged but Amazon did a great job it arrived in perfect condition. Very impressed! | A great item for display for BTTF fans // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2011 // By

 on 27 Dec. 2011 // When I first seen this I wasnt sure why it was quite pricey but when I recieved it I wasnt surprised. The quality of this is absolutely superb. The gull doors open up the way exactly like the DeLorean, the bonnet opens and the wheels turn in the flying position. It actually seems like the actual time machine from the movie but shrunk to a model scale the detail is that good.It has a nice weight to it and solid feel, the box is also very presentable. I keep it stored away though but wouldn't dream of throwing it out. The DeLorean sits comfortable by my old Amiga games on a high shelve.When I got mine though a small part from inside the door had come off, but a spot of strong glue and it's been perfect.I would recommend this to anyone who loves the BTTF movies, it's worth the price for this great quality and really puts all the other cheaper models of the time machine to shame. | Perfect model if only the wheels stayed in place. // 4.0 // 25 July 2012 // By

 on 25 July 2012 // This is a perfect looking model with all the details you expect. The only downside is that the wheel mechanism is a bit flawed. If you want to set the wheels in driving position they don't lock perfectly into place. Whenever I set it to driving position and put it on the display case the wheels always tent to tilt a little and not stay in place.

    Yes - it tips from the front backwards - we have to rip up lots of paper for him to place in the bins to tip in the back then turn the compactor wheel to tip all over the floor again to start all over again.  My grandson who is 2 yrs absolutely adores his garbage truck as he calls it and takes it everywhere with him - the only thing is the wheelie bin handles that clip on the back can be a little bit fragile - I have looked to find replacement wheelie bins because he only has one left but they are £10.00 for 3 which I think is a little bit extortionate.  Although my grandson is only two I think any child up to the age of 5 yrs will have hours of fun with this.

 on 2 Jan. 2015 // I saw this on sale elsewhere and deliberated, after reading the bad reviews if I should spend more on a much more expensive but generally well made alternative. I figured I would gamble on this one and its a gamble thats paid off. It was easy and quick to build, its fully functional (the crane rotates, the claw goes up and down and back and forth). My sons octonauts figurines and playmobil figurines are the right size for it, and its pretty awesome for a kids toy. I'm happy with the construction and expect to get at least a couple of years use out of it. Son is, of course, delighted with it. Probably best suited to children who are old enough to take care of things (not run around knocking everything over types). | Love it!! // 5.0 // 20 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 20 Jan. 2016 // I cant even begin to tell you how much I love this toy! Similar products are soooo expensive compared to this one. I bought it for my son's 4th birthday last week. The crane claw goes up and down, back and forth and the arm rotates. There is also an alternative little platform that can be used instead of the claw. It looks striking and is taller than my son which makes it a really bold, lovely toy! If you have a child who is into knocking things over, it wont be suitable as it will fall over with a good push. This doesn't mean it falls over easily as we all know little kids are strong and like things to crash! My sons autistic and hyper all the time and he manages not to push it over so most 3-4 year olds plus will be fine. Theres space for a little figure to sit in the drivers seat (I didn't get a figure with it as the picture suggests) and theres also a little counter balance box the other end of the arm and a platform. Its just a lovely lovely toy and my son adores it. If you have like JCB digger toys or a duplo farm set or similar you can do some lovely play. Im rather delighted with it and Ive already convinced a mum friend to get it for her son's 4th in a few months! :) | Looks good when built up but a Total Disaster // 2.0 // 26 Dec. 2014 // By

The pod on the nose comes off like the original and is attached via a strong magnet, and this works beautifully.It also comes with a stand, so it looks like it's in flight.A truly beautiful model worthy of any sci-fi collection.

As with all lego it isn't great if you want to then play with it.......but this is robust, big (!!) and great fun.  Beware as the grain could turn into a nightmare but as my son would rather keep it in a bag, it's not a problem to me.  It has lots of functioning/opening parts and has kept his interest for a month or so now when other toys have already been discarded.

 on 16 Jan. 2012 // I didn't know this brand of toys until my then 2.5 year old was offered a tractor and a cement mixer over 1 year ago. I was trully impressed - the toys are just like the real thing and seem to be very durable. We then got him a trailer for his birthday and Santa brought him this harvester last Christmas. It very nicely made as with all Bruder toys it seems. It comes with a bag of grain so can be used like a real harvester.

 on 5 Jan. 2012 // My 8 year-old wanted this truck for Christmas this last year (2011) and I was only able to get it from overseas because Bruder cannot sell John Deere trucks in the US.  I ordered on December 5th and the truck arrived on December 29th...a little late for Christmas and 10 days past it's expected arrival date, but the shipping cost was so low that I couldn't really complain much.As for the toy itself, my son couldn't be happier.  Unlike the harvesters that are available in the US made by Bruder, this one actually functions.  It comes with little plastic pellets that you load into a hopper and you are able to crank them out into a dump truck...this feature was important to my son as he researched combine harvesters exhaustively on the internet and was very emphatic that he had something that 'worked'.  This is a great real-life toy.  It is large and provides hours of fun, indoors and out.  The only small complain that I have is that two of the small lights on top of the Harvester broke off right away.  They have no impact on the function of the vehicle and they are not really missed.

Crane arm extends quite a way which i thought my lad would find a way then to break when at its weakest, not a chance with this! Well worth the money i paid for it, highly recommended. I bought the extra light and sounds module with this, set of blue and orange lights with the truck horn, engine sounds and police siren.

 on 1 Jun. 2015 // Ok I am actually quite surprised at the totally positive reviews for this toy. It is a good toy that my son likes but it has a few flaws. We also had an issue with the product that arrived. So firstly the main drivers unit of the lorry lifts up in a very realistic way to reveal the engine. It is a nice touch but when my son tries to push the crane along the floor it inevitably lifts up, which is frustrating for him. A more secure locking mechanism or something would be better. You can't push from the back due to the crane module which is obviously turns 360 degrees.Second issue was that the support legs for the crane arrived broken. I really didn't want to send it back for such a small thing especially as my son was so happy with his reward for potty training but it was a  bit annoying.summary:crane works greatlooks greatdifficult to push arounddoors don't openpart broken on arrivalNothing world endingly bad but I might have stretched to the more expensive Scania model if I knew what I knew now. | Good Choice // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2010 // By

    It is a model kit which means you have to assemble it from numerous parts and glue it together. Then it has to be painted, something which several builder take very seriously and try to create a life like worn look with rust etc. When finished most of the fun is gone and the model will be placed on the shelf. It is not supposed to go in the water, it will not float straight or even at the right waterline. Eventually it will flood and sink. Moreover lots of delicate plastic parts will break off and become lost. It is not a play toy but a rather accurate scale model.

Unfortunately the colour shifting car stopped colour shifting after a couple of weeks.  Not sure why.  Just stopped in between orange and white - spotty and useless.

 on 4 Jan. 2014 // In case you were wondering, you push this along, let go and it uses a build of momentum type stuff and scuttles along. Quite fun. If the was bought for me then I'm sure this would be fine. I would push the van with a steady but sure hand and then gleefully watch Pat and cat whizz along my carpet. However, this was not bought for me, it was bought for my 2 yr 10 mth daughter who on the 2nd or 3rd push broke it. There is a sealed box inside with a series of plastic cogs and so when pushed with some fury they break straight away. It's then just a plastic van. With Pat. And a cat. | Rather disappointing. // 3.0 // 13 July 2014 // By

Sometimes maybe Pat would like to leave Jess behind on a cat based adventure. Anyway I am pretty sure the DVLA doesn't issue licences continent on you travelling with a cat to remain upright.Jess has a hole in her base to enable her to stay in place, Pat doesn't and I can't understand why as this would be anatomically correct. | Funny toy but not so strong // 3.0 // 8 Jan. 2013 // By

 on 1 Feb. 2009 // I had high hopes for this toy. I was looking for well made wooden vehicles with a variety of classic and recognisable vehicles for a younger child.The print quality of the paint on wood was not brilliant. The colours were dull and even patchy in places - almost as if it needed a sealing undercoat as the pain had sunk in too much.The vehicles are a nice size for smaller hands - but the wheels do tend to stick and do not roll freely on many surfaces. Rubbish on carpet or soft vinyl.He has played with them and does like them - just not as bright and colourful or as ""mobile"" as I had hoped. | Travelling... // 3.0 // 18 Oct. 2009 // By

 on 1 April 2011 // I bought this set of toy vehicles to complement the Le Toy Van Playmat and as you would expect they go with it very well. I much prefer 'old school' style toys that are usually made out of wood as oppose to plastic toys, as they have the potential to last longer and be more durable. The quality of these toys is very good indeed, and there is also a good variety of different types of vehicle meaning that you can invent all sorts of different scenarios with your little ones. Something for everyone.At the time of the review my 4 and 2 yr old have played with these toys a lot and really enjoy them, and despite a lot of play-time with them they show very little wear indeed. Being wood they are almost indestructible, but what is particularly pleasing is that the paint has not chipped off at all. They look as good as new!The only bad thing about toys like this is that in the wrong hands they are deadly weapons!! These toys can do some damage if thrown around or somebody gets hit by them, but of course that would be true of all wooden toys.Buy these, they are good!! | Le toy van london car set // 5.0 // 26 Sept. 2011 // By

It says 'customisers corner shop' on the front of the box and these vehicles are well decorated and look great.The vehicles I received don't look anything like the ones in the photo. The 5 I have are a 50's bronze coloured hotrod, a blue silver and red motorcycle, a burgundy pick up truck and 2 highly decorated sports cars (one orange and one green).

TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 25 Jan. 2016 // I purchased a pack of these from Amazon directly to go with my little boy's Hot Wheel Nitro Bot Attack Set as the set only came with one car which wasn't fun on it's own.  Now the Nitro Bot can chomp on a car whilst holding one and ripping one up with the track while my son fires the other three cars at him to free the other cars and this has made such a difference to the play value of the other set.  The cars are brilliant, really nicely made and more importantly very robust as they have taken a battering over the last few months!The cars are made of some sort of metal and fit the Nitro Bot track perfectly although I believe from the back of the box that they may not be compatible with all Hot Wheels sets so it's probably worth checking before ordering.  I shall definitely be ordering more of these packs in the future as at just over £1 per car these are great and my son will definitely be expanding his Hot Wheels track collections. | Hot Wheels - Value for Money Die-Cast Toy Cars // 4.0 // 2 Nov. 2014 // By

 on 25 Jan. 2016 // I saw this on a special deal here and decided to purchase a number of these for gifts for my nephews, plus 2 young children for their first and 2nd birthday subsequently.  I don’t know what I was expecting when I ordered them, but because of the price I was anticipating them being rather small.  I was mistaken!  When they arrived the packaging was HUGE.  I pity my poor next door neighbour who took it in at my weekend place- she had to store it for a few days.  One thing I really find frustrating with Amazon is that packing is often damaged.  It doesn’t matter when the product is for yourself, but when it is a gift even when there is just a small tear in the outer packaging it looks unprofessional.  Unfortunately this was the case here, and the box was ripped.  The product did arrive much sooner than the stated delivery date which was good.The product itself was a great size- really large, although the book that it was holding is quite small, and not attached particularly well.  It does look of good quality though, and it certainly doesn’t look cheap.  I have already given one of them as a gift for a 2 year old, and they LOVED it.  They started cuddling the rabbit straight away, and then sat there rapt whilst listening to the story.  I haven’t seen the TV show but my friend did say that the voice sounds exactly like it, so that was good.  There seemed to be a variety of different tales available, and they are different each time so they will capture a child’s imagination.  The one problem you might encounter is that if they like one particular story you don’t seem to be able to have the option to repeat it.  I am sure that wouldn’t be an issue though.Although the recommended age for this is older I do think it would be suitable for much younger children.  My nephews are both 1 and one of them in particular loves stories and books so I have no doubt that he will be happy to sit there and take it in. | 5 stars // 5.0 // 8 Oct. 2015 // By

 on 27 Sept. 2012 // This is such a beautiful toy, the picture doesn't do it justice.  It is well made and the animals look really cute.  The tree is also soft and the stitiching is good, so pretty unbreakable, with a handle that makes carrying it around easy.  My 2 year old niece loved it and immediately set about pulling all the animals out and bringing them to life.  The animals in the tree include an owl, a bird, a squirrel, a fox, a badger and a hedgehog.  The fox is slightly bigger than the other animals and is not a finger puppet.  The hedgehog is smaller and I couldn't really get my finger into it properly, however, it is fine for my niece.  I love it and wish I'd bought one for myself too! | Wonderful puppet tree // 5.0 // 30 Sept. 2011 // By

A great puppet - well made, well designed and really excellent value. | Safe fun toy. Loads of laughs with grand kids // 5.0 // 7 Mar. 2015 // By

A good sense of humour developed young is a great asset.It undoes the absurdity of serious life - just when you could be sucked down by life issues. - And no one is immune!Being able to have a good laugh - to share comedic moments - laughs the blues and stresses away.Thank you Puppet Company.

 on 29 Mar. 2010 // Although there are cheaper kits out there I would recommend this one and would be likely to buy this kit again. There are LOADS of stickers allowing more oppourtunity for creativity and for each child to create a very individual looking creature - if you gave different children the same paper bag animal to make they would look different. I like the fact that each unassembled puppet is in its own plastic resealable wrapper - easy to put unused kits aside for another day and know that you have all the pieces & stickers together. The chunky glue stick (one enclosed) is very practical - the type that is pinkish in colour so you can see where the glue has already been applied - but it dries clear. Older children should manage to make their puppet with minimum help maybe just watch that the pieces are glued onto the correct fold of the bag. My kids aged 7 and 5 loved these - and of course the bonus is that you can play with them afterwards. Good strong bags so they are reasonably durable as long as your kids don't go too mad playing with them :-DSometimes I think craft kits are a bit expensive for what they are but I don't begrudge any of the pennies spent on this kit! | Perfect craft project // 5.0 // 14 July 2012 // By

 on 14 July 2012 // This is the most perfect craft project.  Each puppet comes individually wrapped with all the stickers, bags and card pieces required to make a single puppet.  The puppet is simple to put together, the glue holds very well and there are plenty of stickers to keep little fingers happy.  The end results are very impressive - even if you don't quite follow the straightforward instructions.  Each puppet takes about 10 minutes to make, so there is no time to get bored or frustrated.  The puppets have since been put to good use in 'puppet shows'! Truly excellent. | Paper Bag Puppets // 5.0 // 19 Mar. 2013 // By

 on 19 Aug. 2014 // My 3 yr old nephew is very hyperactive child but it was a joy to his parents when he finally sat down to do this craft  - it kept him quiet on a rainy day.  The puppets are easy to do for a child and the pieces stick well together but he needed some help as regards to the instructions - the instructions and pictures are very clear for a child but my nephew only speaks welsh at the moment but when he grows older he will understand it.  The crafts are colourful and the end result is brilliant because he uses his imagination when it comes to playing with the puppets.

We found glueing the bag rather than the cardboard pieces made it more secure and the pink glue which disappeared when dry was great for seeing whether enough glue was on.

All my cats were rather intrigued by it to say the least!My 2 year old niece adores the puppet (she's also a cat lover) and delights in interacting with it when she comes round.

The puppet makers added little details that make the cat more life like, like a little knock in one of the ears and lovely soft nose.Best of all it gets the kids away from the tv and other devices and uses their imagination.

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 17 Jan. 2014 // These are lovely, well-made and very high quality puppets.  The main body is a very thick, long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail and feet) puppet can be used by young children, teenagers or even adults and a 'baby bird' version is available purely for children.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and, unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw, it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  The puppets have different squawks so can 'communicate' together in a variety of tones and pitches but the squarks can also be removed, if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience, including a special needs group of adults.  I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They're very versatile, great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.A very good buy and great fun too, limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination. | Be careful with fluff // 3.0 // 5 May 2014 // By

The ten year old loved it and was quickly playing out scenes with the puppet.  It's a decent size that can be used by adults of children and has quite an expressive face.

Couldn't give it to a kid for fear their parents would hate me for messing up their house with this stuff.  I mean it shed all over the place and the pinky parts were also covered with purple fur.

 on 27 Jan. 2008 // Products by the Puppet Company are always well-made, attractive and well priced but this puppet is a particular gem.  I bought it as I am currently a student teacher and have been using it in lessons with children aged 3-4.  They love it and it has captured their imagination.  Not only is it excellent for behaviour management as the rabbit is shy and can hide/go to sleep in his lettuce if the children misbehave but it is a stimulus for all kind of curriculum topics.  For example, the puppet has prompted discussion about healthy eating, where we live, what we needs to live and how we see/hear etc.  The insect finger puppets hiding in the lettuce leaves are great for minibeast topics and the children enjoy plying with them.As the rabbit is very soft the children love to stroke his fur.  As the lettuce hides your hand it is not obvious to the children that the rabbit is a puppet.  I have also used with older children and they have responded well to it too.I would highly recommend this puppet as a educational tool or as a fun toy for a child to play with. | Adorable // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2008 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2008 // This puppet is just beautiful. It is more effective than a lot of puppets as the lettuce conceals your hand meaning it is really brought to life. Each of the small creatures that live in the leaves (finger puppets) are nicely made and make it good value for money. It says 3+ but I have bought it for younger children as I will use it for storytelling and not as a regular day to day toy.

 on 20 Aug. 2011 // Great toy for story-telling! I use it with my grandaughter whenever we read Peter Rabbit stories together. We also use it for singing the ""Peter Rabbit has a .... on his nose"" song which kids love. Identifying the insects and looking for the real life version is also a great outdoors activity, kids love bugs! My grandaughter (2 years old) also enjoys tucking the insects back into the leaves ""to sleep"" when we have finished with Peter - a great tidy up incentive.

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 30 May 2009 // I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from quality plush fabric and are surprisingly life-like with good features.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with a thumb and finger fingers inserted into the paws and two fingers operating the mouth.This range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun! | A lovely birthday present for our granddaughter // 5.0 // 16 Aug. 2013 // By

She was absolutely delighted with them, and what pleased us most was that we could wear them too, they're so roomy! Not only that, they're really well made and should last for ages. All in all, excellent value for money!My wife and I have no reservations in recommending this item to anyone else who's thinking of buying a glove puppet. | We called him Kevin. // 5.0 // 11 Mar. 2015 // By

 on 19 Oct. 2010 // I felt confident in ordering this toy for my grandchildren aged 2, 3 and 4 because the reviews I had read were very good and I felt that it would have good play value.  I didn't expect the fabric used in the toy to be such good quality and so well made so I was very pleasantly surprised. Lovely silky theatre hangings and a srong looking cotton twill for the shop. I usually leave the assembly of toys to my husband, but I couldn't wait to put the theatre together.  Assembly time was 20 minutes and will be much quicker next time now I have the hang of it.  It was very easy to assemble - no screws or complicated instructions.  I like the fact that this toy can be used on a table top without the bottom half, or free standing.  It can be taken apart and stored in the compact and fairly strong cardboard box with carry handle when its not being used. It arrived within 4 days and cost £12 less than the same one in my local toy shop. This is one of the nicest toys I have ever bought, I definitely recommend it | It was easy to assemble // 3.0 // 30 Sept. 2014 // By

 on 15 May 2011 // After reading all of the positive reviews about this puppet theatre and shop and doing research into others, I chose this product.  It looks great but it has sadly been nothing but a disappointment since we tried to use it.  From our experience, it is not robust or durable or sturdy.  It falls apart when you simply try to move it a couple of inches.  It can't be lifted up and placed somewhere else as the parts do not fit tightly in place.  The sides are forever coming out of the base.  The curtain rods are forever falling out of the sides and so on!  The last straw was as we were trying to set it up again for playing with this morning, we noticed that the curtain fabric has been poorly stitched and is fraying, so it cannot be repaired.  To be honest, it is a great looking toy and we had high hopes for some laughter as my daughter ""performed"". Instead, it's me performing badly everytime she wants to play with it because of my frustrations about it constantly falling apart.  We could glue the dowling pieces or screw the pieces into place but this defeats the purpose of the dual shop/theatre functionality.  Furthermore, it means that it can't be stored for use at a later date or packed up conveniently. Sadly wouldn't recommend. Better off sticking a piece of fabric across a door frame! | TELLTALE THEATRE AND SHOP // 4.0 // 28 Dec. 2009 // By

I bought it for my brother and his kids (aged 3 & 5 yrs); he is 6' and quite a large frame and the puppet fits his arm really well - with me it fitted up to my elbow (5' 6"" female).  It appears well made and easily washable. It has been very popular with both the kids and parents.  The kids usually cannot be distracted whilst they are watching a film or TV, a bit like talking to a brick wall but when the elephant starts talking to them they cannot resist engaging back in conversation.  I can't tell who is enjoying it the most, the parent or the kids but it's providing some wonderful play time. | Gorgeous puppet. // 5.0 // 21 April 2012 // By

 on 27 Jan. 2012 // I brought three of these Monster Puppets from The Puppet Company for two nephews and my niece last Christmas.As they live long distance from each other I gave it to them at New Year when the whole family all got together. They went down a storm, the two boys loved racing about chasing each other roaring loudly and giggling while my niece the older one of the three who had the bright pink monster joined in with grown up role play and created a story and character roles for each of them.Very interactive, creative and they seemed to encouraged them to use imagination through play.Both sets of parents were happy with my choice of gift and I would definitely buy more of these puppets again in the future. | Ours is called Arthur :-) // 5.0 // 15 April 2012 // By

Still too small to use it herself but she has tons of fun watching it and finds the squeak fascinating. Only downside is that my sister keeps moaning to me how she has to pick up purple fluff from her carpet when they play but I'm guessing that's because it's new and she wants a break from cleaning Haha 😂 Oh and also wasn't expecting the squeak to be so high pitched for a big purple monster, is all good though, made me laugh. | Great puppet // 4.0 // 30 Oct. 2011 // By

 on 4 Feb. 2014 // Product arrived promptly, good quality and fits my 60-card deck of MTG including sleeves. The combined price for the box and sleeves is good seeing as some individual packs of 100 of these particular sleeves can cost as much as this set! Also, the sleeves feel and look really nice if you have a best deck (although for large sets of extra cards it would be better to get a cheaper alternative). All in all I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to protect their prized cards while also making them loom and feel good. | Solid product, reasonable price // 4.0 // 26 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2015 // To begin with, the sleeves are excellent - they have very little, if any, stick between them. It's also easy to insert cards, along with removing them. If I had to nitpick about them, I would say that they are a bit pointy on the corners, but that leads to only a mild annoyance. The deck box is clearly high quality upon handling it, however as I've used it a lot, putting decks in and taking decks out, I've become fairly concerned about the hinge on the back being damaged. The box, however, does hold plenty of cards, 100 sleeved I've managed to get in, perfect for holding an EDH/Commander sleeved decks. I'm sure it could fit many more unsleeved. As for the size of the sleeves and the box, all cards fit in them but they are designed for standard sized cards, like MTG or Pokémon cards, rather than Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. | Awesome customer service // 5.0 // 6 Aug. 2012 // By

 on 6 Aug. 2012 // I ordered two of these recently along with some extra deck protectors for my Magic cards. Whilst the box arrived promptly I was rather dissapointed to find that they had sent me the clear version rather than the black ones. I contacted the seller immediatly and they got back to me within hours. The problem was soon rectified after some very dedicated help from customer support. They even let me keep the ones they had accidently sent me as compensation. Wonderfull customer service and I would definatly order from them again. | deck box // 5.0 // 25 May 2014 // By

 on 15 Mar. 2015 // A perfect game to have in the bag to provide to a bored child (age 4+) or adult alike! It has a great black box that opens and closes easily as well as keeping the pieces nicely tightly in it. The pieces are of very good quality, and since they are of different colours, a child can easily learn a pattern of arranged pieces that worked before, helping him or her get started with the next attempt at completing the puzzle again. Both my 4 1/2 year old twin sons have been able to complete the puzzle, one with more ease than the other - interestingly, the one who usually succeeds at completing card board puzzles is the one who has found this puzzle more challenging. I took a photo of the completed game when it arrived, and every time we complete a new arrangement of the pieces, we take a photo - the kids love having their completed challenge being photographed! | Good value, fun puzzle // 5.0 // 20 Sept. 2011 // By

The best ""How To"" Rubik's cube tutorial I have found is by a Swedish guy called Lars Petrus. (I don't think Amazon will let me give a website on this review but it is easy to find).  It has extremely clear animations that you can work through interactively and at your own pace and which show you exactly which move you need to make.  If you are new to the Rubik's Cube, I think you would need at least an hour to read through the explanations and to solve it, but after that your times would rapidly come down. My best time is around 90 seconds which impresses small children, but much slower than the world record which is a truly mind-boggling 10 seconds.My only problem with this particular cube is that some of the stickers came off fairly quickly and the red ones faded (and obviously it snapped with my attempts at high-speed cubing after about 6 months).  However, the same complaints are made of the ""original"" Rubik's Cube Company cube. Hence I have only awarded 3 for durability.This cube was fairly stiff to turn at the start. It can be lubricated simply by getting a normal graphite pencil and drawing on the all the black inner parts of the cube, then rotating it forwards and backwards.  The graphite should help reduce friction between the inner surfaces.  This not only makes it quicker for solving but also easier for children to turn.Read more › | :) // 4.0 // 11 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 9 Nov. 2009 // This is the best quality cube I've ever hade. The stickers are durable, the rotation is very clearly, even with one hand. Some cubes have mechanical difficulties, you should have the right angle with less tolerance to rotate a column, but this cube is very easy to rotate even the colums and rows are not at the same angle. | Poor quality 'Rubik's cube' // 2.0 // 2 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 2 Dec. 2013 // The quality was surprisingly poor, the stickers are peeling off at the corners within a couple of weeks of use. I suppose the plus side is that it is easier to cheat now.

 on 19 April 2014 // My 7 year old son has been fascinated by the Rubik's Cube since seeing his friends with them at school.  He begged for one and so we bought this one.  It is of a reasonable standard, but the stickers are beginning to peel at the edges after only a small amount of use.  The turning mechanism appears OK at the moment.  Not sure I would purchase another one of these - would like to see them make one without stickers, just coloured plastic that would be more durable ;-)","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""HOSELET"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£9.29""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Creston"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£9.29""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""RedTag Event"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£9.30""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""SycoBloom"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£9.76""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""24/7 DIRECT"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£9.90""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Wi-Shop"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£9.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""windsor goods"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£9.99""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Bonisell"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£10.00""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""Blue Trade"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£11.99""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""K Direct"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£12.00""}]}"

 on 19 Nov. 2015 // This is such a fun game! Based on the board game monopoly but more fast paced and interesting. You still have to collect the streets, stations and utility sets and its the first to get three sets who wins.  You have money too and can be charged rent etc. but there are cards in the pack which can be played that may cause you to have to swap, sell or give up your properties. Its a great game of strategy but it doesn't take days to play.(only minutes)  We play it with the kids, age 4 and 7 and together on our own. Nice and compact its great to play anywhere, easy to learn and a great gift to give to someone else. | 10/10 addictive game, don't be put off by the reputation that monopoly takes forever. // 5.0 // 2 Jan. 2016 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 2 May 2015 // The Bicycle Vintage ""Dragon Back"" Deck is a really smart looking pack but in Gold it looks terrific.The Court cards have a great look with a toned metallic green which looks- well regal.Of course the big attraction is the card backs which it is reputed is an old design filed and forgotten for years then rediscovered by a worker at Bicycle.They like the design and chose to release it to the public.This is an attractive and impressive deck for magicians the sheen looks really professional.Certainly when I use it for tricks it really gets the trick off to a good start if you have a great looking deck like this.The red dragons give and Oriental air of mystery so to speak.The 'Tarot' card referred to is in actual fact a 'Gaff' card.It's double backed so nothing to write home about but an extra which is always welcome.The back includes a couple of 'Trade' cards which are always useful if you need to make your own Gaffs.In actions the cards perform well.They fan out and are easily manipulated as are all Bicycle brands. The airflow ensures the slide easily.I used to used 'Bee' brand for many years. Bee are a subsidiary of Bicycle but I must admit I prefer to use Bicycle.A really smart looking deck that performs well.The cards are also available in Blue, Red, Green.

At first I was a little sceptical about the whole 'air cushioned' business, but the difference is there. The cards are ever so 'slippy' against each other, making spreading the deck and fanning it very easy. In comparison to Waddingtons, they just feel far more well made.

 on 7 Dec. 2015 // Purchased 2 packs of these cards for an upcoming cruise, as I like the idea of our group of 8 sitting on a cruise ship playing with a huge deck of cards, although I haven't told the others yet!Slightly disappointed the cards are NOT in fact UK A4 size, despite the product headline. They resemble the American equivalent, which I think is referred to as 'Letter' size. Also slightly disappointed by the fact that one pack had damaged corners, despite what appeared to be good packaging, so I'm guessing they may have got dropped at some point prior to despatch.Despite these fairly trivial disappointments, they will easily serve the purpose they were bought for and in case you're wondering, there are also 2 Joker cards included per pack. Would buy again, unless accurate A4-sized cards were specifically required. | Just the job // 5.0 // 19 July 2013 // By

Our sons have been playing this from an early age and now the grandsons are playing it as well (5 and 7) A very good game that gets your mind really going as you try to work out a forward plan to put your tiles down, only to be thwarted by another player before its your turn.

 on 4 Jan. 2016 // I ordered Mr Lister’s Quiz Shootout (MLQS from now on) along with the rather fantastic Qwordie a couple of weeks ago and have been delighted with it. I’ve played it with groups from 5-25 people.As explained in my review of Qwordie, I run a boardgames club at a boys secondary school (ages 11-16). The responses have been overwhelmingly positive.In MLQS you have as many teams as you like and you fire off questions such as: What are the ingredients in a Big Mac?Teams list everything they can think of and then take turns to give an answer at a time. Wrong answers or blanks get you eliminated. Certain answers are golden as they are more obscure eg McD’s special sauce.Once all the answers are given, any remaining teams or golden answer givers go through to the Shootout Round: Generally a guesstimate question eg How many Big Macs did McD’s sell in 2014? Closest answer wins!You win a card which has a bottle on the back and the goal is to win 3 different bottles to win the whole game.It’s simple, it takes seconds to explain and players can drop in and out of teams at will: we even ended up with 2 big teams and used the Shootout question as a double or nothing round for cards and points.I’ve even started using it at the start or end of lessons to focus students. Quite simply: they love it! | Perfect for Christmas. // 5.0 // 21 Sept. 2015 // By

 on 26 Jan. 2016 // Such a simple but fantastic game! Having never heard of Mr Lister, I thought it was worth a punt for £15...I wasn't disappointed! The game can easily be played as individuals or teams (we played as 6 teams of pairs with one quiz master). The questions are all current (some referencing 2015) and are all suited to the UK (no random American questions). The majority of the question cards really got the competitiveness going and were all pitched at just the right level (not University challenge). The idea of the golden answers also built the suspense when going around the group, and encourages people to give more alternative answers rather than just going for the easy ones. All in all a great party game that can last for as long as you want it to (just decide how many cards the winner needs to collect). Highly recommended | Fantastic fun // 5.0 // 9 Dec. 2015 // By

He really likes it, so its fun but now I wish I'd gotten a big version with more activities. Nevertheless, this game is very fun and good for anyone from around 7 years. The questions never get old and makes you think, unlike a lot of games for children. The cards are nice, large and glossy, giving the game a nice feel.

Hosting a party? Stuck in an airport? Then it's time for Uno, the classic card game, which is quick to learn, easy to play and fun for all the family. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, by getting rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents. You score points for all the cards left in your opponents' hands. The rules of Uno are simple. Every player picks a card and the person who draws the highest number deals (Action Cards count as zero at this stage). Once the pack has been shuffled, each player is dealt 7 cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form a DRAW pile. And the top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to start a DISCARD pile. The person to the left of the dealer starts play and has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number or colour. So, if the card is a red 7, the player must put down a red card or any 7 card regardless of its colour. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have a card to match the one on the DISCARD pile, they must take a card from the DRAW pile. If this can be played, the player is free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person. Players may choose not to play a playable card from their hand. If so, they must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, but the player may not use a card from the hand after the draw. Players race to get rid of their cards and the real fun starts when special Action Cards are used to foil opponents and gain an advantage. With the tension mounting, Uno becomes the fun family card game that's easy to pick up but impossible to put down.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 5 Oct. 2011 // Like many people, I had heard of the card game Uno, but didn't really know anything about it or how it was played. This changed last summer, when we went on holiday as a family to Whitby. Six of us were staying in a self catering cottage, and my mother in law was singing the praises of this card game that she had been playing a couple of weeks earlier when she visited her sister, saying it would be the perfect game to play as a family indoorsif it was raining (which it was!).She managed to pick one up from the local toy shop for £[], which seemed a bit of a steep price to pay for what was essentially a pack of cards! The game is made by Mattel, brand leaders in the games industry and is suitable for 2-10 players. The box states that it is for ages 7+, but I think most kids over 4 would manage the game relatively easily, as it is quite simple.The game itself is very similar to a card game that we used to play with a regular deck of cards, in which someone puts a card down and the next player has to follow suit or number and if they can't they have to pick up a card. The winner is the person to get rid of all of his/her cards first.Uno have simplified the game further, replacing the traditional suits of cards with four bold colours: blue, green, yellow and red. Most of the cards have number values on them from 0 to 9. A set number of cards are dealt to each player, with the remainder forming a pickup pile on the table. The aim of the game is to play clockwise around the table, with each player placing a card that matches the number or colour of the previous card placed, with the object of losing all of his/her cards.Read more › | There's even a typo in the Instruction // 3.0 // 29 Oct. 2015 // By

Also I noticed that on the back of the package it has ""Maximum retail price: ₹129 "" and the manufactory address is India I guess, what's worse the instruction inside I noticed a typo in ""Going out"" section, read ""If you don't yell 'UND'"" ?? it clearly printed 'UND' as opposed to ""UNO"".I can still use this cards but I'm not sure if this is the geniune UNO cards | Great game for all ages // 5.0 // 30 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 21 Mar. 2014 // My daughter wanted this as she had been playing it at her After School Club. She's quite a expert tactician with it now. Read the reviews about it being some sort of unofficial version. I don't believe this to be the case. The box and the cards are of high quality. Didn't need to read the instructions as we already knew how to play it. Only downside (and hence the 4 stars) is that the cards don't shuffle well like playing cards should. It's as if the card is too thick or has too blunt an edge. However I am sure with plenty of use they will become more pliable and shuffle more easily. | Fantastic Family Card Game // 5.0 // 14 Jan. 2014 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 14 Jan. 2014 // Uno is a fantastic family card game that's really stood the test of time.I can remember enthusiastically playing this as a child, and now my children received it for Christmas we play it just as enthusiastically as a family.  The rules are so simple, they're almost self-explanatory; one game is all you need to master the rules. Just like in an adult card game it's all about concealing your hand from your opponents and playing each card strategically; the aim is to get rid of your hand first.You can play Uno one game at a time or keep a cumulative score, with the winner from each round scoring points for the cards left with his opponents; the supreme winner being the first to 500.Since we got our Uno game I've discovered more other, grown-up friends who play it too, instead of normal card games. And there are so many variations to play, including multiplying the consequence cards and quick-fire rounds.We spent New Years Eve playing this with friends and their children, with around 8 players; we had a fantastic night, filled with fun and laughter.Uno is a brilliant, versatile game that appeals to all ages from around six years and up. And as it's just an large deck of cards it's small enough to pack for holiday, take on long journeys or play anywhere when you have a bit of free time on your hands.Recommeded!! | dissatisfied with the quality // 1.0 // 17 Feb. 2014 // By

 on 29 Nov. 2014 // The tin contains two set of playing cards with illustrations from the first four Harry Potter books. I liked it very much, especially the coloured illustrations on the Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces, which are by Mary GrandPré (I think. It's certainly in her style).Each colour has illustrations from one of the books (f.i. the spades have illustrations from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). The illustrations on the numbers are a lot more plain. Some of those are still very nice, although I think others could have been better (hence 4 stars instead of 5).","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""TOYS.inc"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£13.99""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Nirvana Bridge Media"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£16.95""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""through-the-arched-window"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£12.99""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""M&E Store-UK"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£112.97""}]}"

 on 8 Dec. 2015 // I was a big fan of Game of Thrones Living Card Game (LCG) 1.0 and was heavily invested in that game. In all honesty though 1st edition had run its course with it extensive card catalogue, which made it difficult for new players, and broken game mechanics the game needed a complete re-boot. At first I was gutted that I would have to re-buy all the cards and start again as none of the 1st edition cards can be used in 2nd edition, but after seeing the new cards in 2nd edition I can see it's totally worth it! Of all the LCGs available Game of Thrones has always been my favourite.The designers have done a fantastic job tightening up the mechanics of the game and making it simpler. Be under no illusion, this is a complicated game to play when you take into account all the rules and then each cards abilities, where those abilities fit within the turn structure etc. However, compared to 1st edition, this is now much more thought out. There is now a lot more focus on challenges, challenge based effects and playing the game rather than a card having super abilities that completely cripple an opponents decks ability to make challenges in the game!I love the whole Game of Thrones lore and this game allows you to immerse yourself in eight different factions of the series. There are more characters than from just the TV series but you don't have to have read the books to appreciate the game. The factions included are Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Targaryen, Greyjoy, Martell and new to second edition Tyrell and Nights Watch.One of the biggest appeals for this game is deck building. Straight out of the core box you can make decks, most by allying two factions together to give you enough cards in a deck (e.g.Read more › | Get it // 5.0 // 11 Oct. 2015 // By

In the past, we have been using sheets of paper printed and taped together, but it was never a good solution.This mat is writable, cleanable, doesn't have strange seams when properly rolled and in overall good quality. I will although recommend try to cover the play table with sheets of paper to measure the the size before purchase. 120 cm x 85 cm doesn't sound like much, but it really is a _lot_ of space. | Lino with a grid on it // 4.0 // 19 Feb. 2013 // By

It's dry wipe so you can use board  pens on it and erase with a damped cloth if needed. It's basically made out of linoleum (the same stuff that flooring is basically made of) So it's pretty expensive for what the product actually is considering I recently bought a much bigger white board for an additional £5.

Very happy with my choice of train set, as was going to buy Chugginton interactive train set but after reading reviews changed my mind and opted for this train set. My 2 year old son is very happy playing ""CHOO CHOO"" as he calls it. The next best thing about it is the chugginton interactive trains (ie - wilson,brewster,koko etc) all fit the track.To round up very good buy for learning the London land marks and hours of fun for all. | They love it // 5.0 // 19 April 2011 // By

 on 19 April 2011 // My 17-month old twins girls love this set.  We got it a couple of months ago.  At first they only really played with the smaller vehicles on the floor(and learnt how to say words like ""taxi"").  Then they started rolling them on the bridge.  And now they are assembling the track, rolling all the vehicles along and putting up the buidings, trees and people around it.  I like the fact that they are buildings of London and that the train is a tube train.  Quality seems great, although we haven't had it for that long yet.  Track pieces fit together easily and the tube train compartments attach with magnets, which are also ok for little ones to do on their own.  Only (minor) gripe is that most the buildings are rather flat and fall over easily. | Great fun for kids and grown-ups // 5.0 // 1 Jan. 2011 // By

 on 1 Jan. 2011 // A really charming train set, which helps my little girl to learn the London landmarks, and all the various vehicles (black cabs, tube trains, buses, etc) that one might see in the capital. There are absolutely loads of pieces and track, which really spark children's imaginations, though it must be said the adults probably get as much out of it, and there is much discussion as to where the landmarks should be placed! It keeps my little girl occupied for ages, and she asks to play with it daily, which is a good indication of its appeal to children. | Traintastic // 5.0 // 25 May 2011 // By

You get six well designed characters, all neatly printed (sometimes printing of features on these things is dire, wonkey eyes etc), and well proportioned as a set. Maybe a bit steep price wise, but to be honest I think its good value. Amazon further reduced them just as I was buying and gave me super saver shipping.

 on 20 Feb. 2014 // My 6 year old boy has various Playmobil sets and this one is great. It forms an outlying camp that gets the focus every now and then. The different characters are great for jusing in different ways - whether it's just the camp itself or the wolf making friends with another set of characters or.... it's very good. | Top quality // 4.0 // 24 Mar. 2014 // By

The teepee takes quite a bit of putting together but this is because of the good design and durability.

TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 18 Feb. 2014 // Set of 7 very small plastic dinosaur figures in the Megasaurus series. There are other dinosaur figures to collect plus farm and zoo animals. The box is a nice addition. The inner box slips out and has a painted background children can use as a small stage for their creatures to play on.These little figures are a firm favourite in our house. They last a long time and are very durable for their size, I haven't experienced any of the heads, feet or tails snapping off, they're nicely painted and quite realistic. We have a few different sets.Watch out when you open the box. The figures are held tightly upright by a host of tiny plastic tabs and wire - takes ages to untie them. | Excellent quality and Value // 5.0 // 10 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 6 Jan. 2015 // My 4 year old grand daughter loved it once grandad had spent an hour putting it together (After Christmas day lunch....it wasnt easy!). Once assembled it takes about 2 to 3 minutes to put all the bits of the volcano together and then grand daughter presses a button and the volcano erupts (kind of) and the top pops off and their is an avalanche of sorts as the side of the volcano slides down. The eruption takes about 1 second to be followed by grandad putting everything back in place (2 to 3 minutes) and repeat...endlessly!granddaughter then discovered the trilobite fossil can be eaten by the dinosaur (and gets stuck in the dinosaurs mouth between its teeth) which she found highly amusing. After about an hour she found she could easily fit herself in the box this came in, close the box and then jump out! ( its a BIG box) which then became her favorite game of Christmas for the next hour. | Fun Toy for Most Dinosaur Loving Kids! // 5.0 // 29 Sept. 2013 // By

 on 29 Jan. 2016 // I recently purchased this product for my son's Birthday and I could not be happier. The product itself is a fantastic concept for children over the age of 4 and is suitable for both boys and girls.The box includes lots of small accessories however it also includes some fun dinosaurs and an erupting volcano! I did find it hard to set the volcano up however once it was set up, it was easy to use and seems to be childproof against my son's playing.This set is pricer than most of the Playmobil sets however this is a key set if your child loves the Dinos range. We have a lot of the smaller Dino sets and nothing comes close to how good this set is.The accessories you will find in this set include trees, people, dinos - overall great quality and a well thought out set from Playmobil | Alright i guess. // 3.0 // 4 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 4 Jan. 2016 // A lot of small parts for very young children and was a bit of a pain setting up. But the child likes it although I can safely say half the stuff will be lost in no time.

 on 26 Dec. 2013 // This was bought some time ago for my 8 yr old son and put aside for Christmas (yesterday).  He was originally more interested in the Spartan JFO figure than the rocket launcher.  However, with my finding a Warthog for him to attach it to it became an even better buy.The figure itself is up to the usual standard with steel and blue paintwork that is made to look suitably weathered and the normal amount of articulation for the Halo Reach range of figures. Note.  This figure does not come with any personal weapons.The rocket launcher fits into the warthog with no problems and turns easily in 360 degrees.  Again the weathering is well done.  Both sets of tubes can be moved up and down, with enough room between the two sets of launch tubes for the Spartan to stand but the grips for the operator to hold appear very flimsy and are too close together for the figure to get a good grip due to the design of his hands.  To get your figure to have any type of grip you have to place his arms close in to his body with his hands nearly touching.  It helps to have the nearest launch tube turned upwards to give you more space.  It can be done but it is a bit fiddly.  Such an oversight detracts from what is for the most part a well thought out item.How durable this item will be depends on how its going to be used.  If It's going to be played with then depending on how rough someone is I suspect the grips will be the first things to break.  As to how good a buy it is, then that depends on what disposable income you have, what price you can get it for, and of course, how much you want it.  I think I paid between £12 and £15 for this at the time along with the canon and operator at just under £10 with free p&p which I think is about right for the quality and as a stand alone item. | replacement cannon // 5.0 // 3 Aug. 2011 // By

VINE VOICE on 31 Dec. 2015 // I bought this figure as a Christmas present for my daughter as she loves Batgirl. Although the figure does look fantastic we did have a problem when she came to open the packaging. Unfortunately due to the way the figure is packaged with the Cape slotted through a plastic backing, while trying to remove it Batgirl's head fell off!! How about that then. To me this was caused by the way it was packaged and a lack of good glue to the shoulder and neck joining. That said with some good strength glue we soon sorted the problem out. However to be fair this really isn't what you would expect from a figure that is brand new and not even out of the box so to speak. If you do happen to purchase the figure I would recommend being really careful when removing the figure from the packaging. Other than this my daughter loves the figure. | Good toy // 5.0 // 15 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 3 Jan. 2013 // felt pens - buy a better quality set rather than repeat buying of cheap and nasty ones and buy a box rather than smaller sets for even greater valuethis set is tried and tested and used regularly with a group of children on a twice weekly basis.- yes the colour does wash out if accidents happen- yes they can be revived if caps are left off or loosely fitted before putting away- yes they last ages and have a hard wearing tip so nib doesnt disappear with slight pressure- gives good results and cardboard partitions in the box make it easy to keep colours separate for group use - plenty to go round.- if you're wondering to buy fine or broad tips? - depends on the age group but these are more versatile and holding at a slight angle gives great broad line coverage for larger areas | As described, bargain price // 5.0 // 10 Aug. 2013 // By

The pens are separated into their own colours in the box, so don't arrive all muddled up which is great. Pens all perfect condition and just as described. I have found from past experience that the Crayola pens are long lasting and sturdy, so even with young children using them with too much force, the tips of them don't get all mushed up and broken. | No more fighting! // 5.0 // 15 Jan. 2014 // By

They are neatly presented in a cardboard box, (which is easy to fold and recycle/dispose of!) and contain the 4 rounded pencils.They are slightly smaller than I was expecting, however, they worked perfectly and made the presents complete! When using the pencils, they last an adequate amount of time for their purpose, and can easily see through a full days colouring.I would recommend these as stocking/party bag fillers for children over the age of 36 months.

 on 1 Jun. 2011 // I bought this as a gift for my brother's 14th birthday. He's not a serious artist, but he does like to do a bit of artwork in his spare time, on rainy days and with the Summer holidays approaching, I thought this would be ideal. I was not disappointed. Although I live in a different city from my brother and have not seen the art set first hand, I am told that it is more than satisfactory for young, budding artists. My Step-Dad, who knows far more about art than I do, said that Reeves are a well known and reliable brand, and he was impressed with the set himself.Unfortunately, I am no expert in the field, but if you want to buy this as a gift for a young person who likes drawing and painting, then I cannot see you going wrong with this. | Great for the budding artist! // 5.0 // 6 Jun. 2011 // By

This set has proved to be a lifesaver to us as my brother is autistic and very fussy about doing his work to the letter, and with this kit that is never a problem! 1 issue tho is that the wooden case is a little cheap feeling so we transferred the supplies to an art drawer in a work desk. | Everything in one place // 4.0 // 20 Aug. 2011 // By

Not a problem as such, but whilst putting them back I noticed some colours repeated.  This led me to investigate the bottom layer and although there ARE 60 colouring pencils in total there were less than 30 colours!  All four of the oranges were the exact same shade with the rest having 2 shades of each colour.I admit I feel a bit cheated.  This gift is for my daughter's birthday next month and I'm contemplating sending it back for the above reasons.Probably a great 'shared' gift where both kids want the 'dark blue', but certainly not what I was expecting. | What more could you really expect // 3.0 // 9 May 2013 // By

 on 9 May 2013 // I bought this for my niece who was over the moon with it. When I received it I opened it up as I had read previous reviews, some good, some not so good. I was glad I did, the pencils are not held in so it looked a complete mess. I rearranged them and Sellotaped a piece of card over each layer. This held them in place for when my niece opened it herself. She will always have to keep the card on the pencils or they will always be all over the place ach time she opens the box. I think this could have been easily overcome when the pencil holders were made and at probably no extra cost.

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Aug. 2010 // These pens are great! We first bought a pack of these ages ago, (over 2 years), and they have lasted and lasted. Finally, a couple of them seemed like they were going to give up the ghost, (after a huge amount of use), and so I have just invested in a new pack. I hope that these last as long!Whilst you might think that glitter pens would be a bit...well...girlie, these pens really aren't. The only ""girlie"" colour in there is pink, and my two little boys enjoy using that to write cards to their girl friends, or grandma etc. The other colours are gold, green, blue, orange, and purple and they are all wonderful, vivid colours. The sparkle, whilst clearly there, is fairly subtle. The pens produce a lovely, relatively fine line, so they're not great for colouring in but for producing writing that you want to stand out they really excel! We absolutely love using these to write cards as they really do make the writing look so special. A minor issue that we've come across is that you get a lot of colour out of these pens and the writing can be wet for a little while - not so much a problem for most perhaps, but my little left-hander often struggles not to smudge his writing when using these. Of course, that would be the same with a lot of other pens too, and he loves these ones so much that he persists with them.When the ink in our new pack of pens runs out, we will be buying more. For us they have been amazing value for money...so much so that perhaps I should buy my own pack, instead of constantly stealing the kids pens!! :) Highly recommended. | Nice shiny colours // 3.0 // 11 Feb. 2012 // By

 on 3 May 2015 // Bought this set, along with the animals set,  for my daughters 7th birthday after she had seen them advertised on the TV and although they have been a hit with her I was left feeling a little unimpressed with the contents of the box.Firstly there was an expectation of the stencils being at least the size of the box (just proud of A4).  This was not the case they were more A5 in size.Secondly the quality of the stencils were found to be a little wanting as they are made from rather flimsy card and I would question the life span of the stencils being made from such a cheap material (the box actually states that the stencils are 'reusable' although I'd question their longevity).Thirdly, and most annoyingly, the stencils are not ready to use out the box.  Essentially they arrive with the pattern/picture perforated into the card and you then have to pop each of the pieces out.  This posed three problems... 1) due to the flimsy cheap card used each stencil is easily damage if due care and attention is not paid... 2) my 7 year quickly lost interest as she wasn't really able to perform the intricate task of removing some of the pieces of card and... 3) it took myself, and the wife, a considerable amount of time to remove pieces of card from each stencil (okay a rather small point but rightly or wrongly I assumed that they would be ready to use).Despite my 3 groans above the stencil sets were well received by my daughter however I will not be purchasing any further products from John Adams without prior investigation.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£10.00""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Limitless!"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£10.00""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Buy-For-Less-Online"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£11.52""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Shop_To"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£13.57""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""Fun Collectables"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£13.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Splash And Relax"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£14.23""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""Gameseek"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£15.36""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""itstoytastic"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£16.90""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""Howleys Toy Shop"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£12.99""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""It's All Fun & Games"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£18.95""}]}"

 on 3 April 2011 // Who ever thought that it would make any kind of difference what markers you buy?! Well, wait till your 3 year old becomes obsessed with colouring. Turns out, there are quite a few features you can want in a marker (other than: it works!) and these seem to have them all.Demand no.1, 2 and 3 (for me at least) washability!!! Turns out, many manufacturers are liars, but these wash out of anything so far. Clothes, faces, hands, hardwood floors, table cloths and furniture fabric.The colours are vibrant and with 14 in a pack, lot's to choose from. They colour at any angle (unlike the Crayola Beginnings, which seems to work less at an angle). They fit tiny hands well but because the caps are large and fit tightly on the other end, you can transform them into grown up size markers if your kid wants you to help out (also like, stated in an other review, the size makes them less of a chocking hazard). The last very long (had them since xmas and my girl colours A LOT) and so far, seem to be crush-proof.Lastly, because they are small, they are ideal to pop in little compartments of (hand)bag, car door, stroller, etc. with a few sheets of paper as instant entertainment on the go.(oh yeah, and my girl loves to stick them together tip to end and make long towers :-) )Brilliant value for money, will be buying them again and again (though so far, the first pack is still working fine, knock wood) | these are great // 5.0 // 17 Nov. 2008 // By

 on 17 Nov. 2008 // I'd add to the above review, which is spot on, that these pens have the added bonus of very large lids - If you have one of those 'keep you on the edge of your seat' kids who insist on trying to choke themselves on(or put in their eyes, ears and up their nose) anything to hand these are brilliant as they simply can't fit them in!!!

 on 31 Jan. 2011 // These pens are great for little fingers. My daughter is 19 months and holds the pens really nicely because they are not too big. They have the benefit of being washable which is in my opinion a must. I would really like to see some pens that are triangle in shape as the only downfall as with most pens is that they roll off the table. | Durable and sturdy first colouring pens // 5.0 // 21 Feb. 2012 // By

 on 21 Feb. 2012 // These were bought for my 3 year old and have proved to be a bit hit - the colours are lovely and bright, the pens easy to hold and they have lasted well.  From my point of view, I like the fact that the lids click on securely and fit on the end of the pen when in use - this has prevented the lids being lost, as has happened with countless other pens.My 16 month old has also started using these - they are chunky enough for her to hold and have no small bits she can swallow.  The thick nibs have also stood up really well to a more heavy-handed approach!The only downside (for those of us with kids that colour everything except the paper!) is that the ink is a bit of a pain to get off of skin.  It does come off, but not before I have a very grumpy toddler!  However, it washes out of clothes fine, in my experience.Overall, highly recommended for all budding artists! | great to carry around // 5.0 // 17 Nov. 2008 // By

 on 10 April 2011 // In a nutshell these 'Pipsqueaks' are fab little pens. Lots of colours in a set that have good felt nibs to them.For my daughters I keep them in the car for car trips as I find they are ideal to use and don't take up a lot of space.Not only are they washable (I found marks on the carpet and they came out quite easily) which is good news for Mums, or any parent/carer but they are colourful & bright too and I think little ones are motivated more when using these compared to boring grey or even coloured pencils or crayons. I remember how frustrating it was for my daughter when she pressed down on her pencils so hard that they snapped too often. With these you need very little effort at all before you see the wet colours glide on the page. We love the names each shade has been given as well: Dinky Pink, Little Boy Blue and Golden Nugget to name just three.My daughter actually learnt to write her name using these pens, and later with the slimmer Crayola Supertips Washable - Pack of 12 as well.They encourage excellent pen control from the very start, so there's no need to buy x.large chunky crayons or markers thinking they will suit your toddler better (in my opinion they won't).Crayola Pip-Squeaks are just perfect for learning little hands! | Good value - small markers - very suitable for toddlers // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 31 Dec. 2010 // We have these and the Crayola Beginners markers, and these are much better. The fact that these markers are smaller, enables the child to have better grip and control over them. They come with 14 colours so plenty to use and loose! It is great they are washable, as my daughter draws on her fingers/hands/feet/clothes, and we have been always to remove the stains by a simple rinse.Highly Recommended. | These markers never loose their appeal // 5.0 // 3 Jun. 2011 // By

 on 3 Jun. 2011 // My son can color with these markers all day! The size is perfect for his little hands and he loves the bright colors. We are learning the names of the colors while he draws.They are extremely washable too, just a quick wipe with a cloth and any marks on the floor/wall/table go away. Washes out of clothes easily and washes off skin right away under the tap, if he chooses to color his arms!I am very happy with these.

 on 2 Dec. 2011 // I have a big white board on my wall and a small A4 white board that I can carry around with me and jot on. The A4 board came with a little pen, but that broke soon after purchase so I had to use one of my big thick markers that I usually use on the big board. If anyone has used these before, then they will know how much they stink. It's not so bad when using them on the big board, but when your using them close to you, like I was when I write on the A4 board, then it becomes a problem. It came to a point where I was getting headaches, so I decided to get another pen. A smaller pen. I got this pen.It is perfect for writing on small surfaces. You can hold it exactly like a Biro and have maximum control. The nib is small so you can fit a lot of writing in if you have a small white board. It even comes with an eraser on the end. I have been using it for 4 months now and it is still going. Remarkably the eraser is still working too. I thought it would run out of use fairly quickly as it is not that big, but it is great.

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 30 Sept. 2014 // The nib is fine enough to allow for acceptable handwriting, but not so small that it would match a handwriting pen. Ink flows easily and judicious use of pressure should ensure that the nib/point doesn't 'fatten' out too soon. Ink is easily rubbed off when required and the included eraser pad is a nice touch at this price point.

 on 10 Nov. 2012 // Weirdly it has been these pens that have really sparked my son's interest in getting down to do his homework. He has produced some magnificent posters for science, history and geography as well as his favourite hobby of cartooning. He even looks after them and puts them away afterwards which is a first. The pens blend well, are easy to handle and the colours are vibrant. I would definitely recommend investing in these over any number of cheaper felt tip colours for the same cost. The pens will bleed through standard paper and mark the surface underneath so either invest in a good quality ream of A3 or make sure that your table is otherwise protected. Have yet to run dry despite extensive use. | letraset promarkers // 5.0 // 23 Oct. 2011 // By

 on 23 Oct. 2011 // Great pens, they have a pointed end for detail and a flat end for colouring larger areas, they are great, blender pen is a good extra and fades colour out well. However they won't last long as my son has been doing graffiti styles in his black book since arrival and the mauve is nearly run out.

    Mr. Michael Smith
  
 on 11 Dec. 2011 // These are not your average Felt-Tip pens. The price might lead you to that conclusion anyway. They originated as - and still are - professional tools for Graphic Designers who were / are familiar with Letraset's Pantone (R) colours, which were the standard for Print. These are serious Artist's tools, (hence the 'Pro' in the name perhaps) and are manufactured with that in mind. So don't buy these if all you want to do is block-fill the inside of the black lines in a child's colouring book. The ink is specially formulated and the Blending Pen is a useful tool for avoiding having to purchase other Pens in intermediate spectrum colours. The Blending pen needs to be cleaned to eradicate unwanted colour that it will accumulate.Letraset's original Pantone Markers (single tip) and their follow-up ""TRIA"" format (with 3 standard, ultra-fine and wedge tips) also had the option of using a specifically-designed Airbrush attachment. Although the Pens here look exactly like the Tria, I don't know if they are tooled to fit the Airbrush adaptor for the Tria range, but I'm sure I'll soon find out. The adaptor is one of my prized possessions. It may be long out of production, so might be worth quite a bit :-)Durability: When used sparingly, for their intended purpose, they can last almost a lifetime. I have 3 original Pantone Markers which I've had since 1975 and even though I've used them sparingly they all work perfectly today. (2011)Educational: They do offer more realistic and subtle colour options with which to work. If a 12 pen set - all grey - makes you scratch your head, then they will help in teaching a child to look at colours in real life and to use the pens to realise shadings, tones and such.

#1 HALL OF FAMETOP 10 REVIEWER on 21 Sept. 2013 // We've bought quite a few Melissa and Doug toys over the years and have been very happy with them so my daughter bought this as a birthday gift for her four year old cousin.In the very nice velvet lined box you get several basic musical instruments.- Clacker- Cymbals- Tambourine- Tone blocks- Maracas- TriangleThe instruments are well made and feel nice in the hand. In use the clacker, tambourine, tone blocks and triangle make a good sound. The maracas are a bit quiet and could do with more rice or seeds inside them to give them more of a 'shic shac' and the cymbals are a tad tinny to be honest. But overall this is a great little set to introduce music/sounds and rhythm to a child.Recommended | Ok for two years old but not for older // 2.0 // 30 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 6 Dec. 2009 // This set looks fantastic and comes beautifully packaged in a lovely wooden box, but once it's unpacked the quality of the instruments is disappointing.  The tambourine is tinny, the cymbals are flimsy, the maraccas are very quiet, and the clacker didn't clack.  It looks like great value but you get what you pay for.

 on 20 Jan. 2014 // This is the second Tangle I've owned.  The first was the Tangle Relax, and I'll compare this one to my Relax.This Tangle is durable.  The Tangle Relax has a rubbery (but not sticky) texture, this Tangle is made of hard plastic.  I still love the Relax, and I bought a replacement for it, but it's not going to last forever. I assumed that would be the case when I bought it.  If long-term durability is important for you, this one is better.This Tangle is easy to keep clean.  I love the way the Relax feels, but it's surface makes it less than ideal at times.  It would get dirty, and after awhile, it started looking permanently dirty.  This one is better for taking out and about, shoving in pockets or purses, and for places with lots of germs.This Tangle stays posed.  I don't know how to explain it, but the Relax is floppy.  You don't even have to shake it to get it to lose it's form.  This Tangle can be posed and will stay put.This Tangle doesn't necessarily match the picture.  This is a big deal for some, and not a big deal for others.  I enjoyed the surpise, but others may want something more specific.  Also, if you want ""girl"" colours or ""boy"" colours, there are other sellers who offer that.This Tangle doesn't lay flat.  The Relax comes with exactly 20 pieces, and you can put it in shapes that lay perfectly flat.  This one has 18 pieces, so I'd either have to remove two pieces or buy a second and add two peices to make it lay flat.Buying a second might be a good idea anyway.  If this is your first Tangle, be prepared for people to ask to hold it and play with it.  This always drives me a bit crazy, and I like having a ""backup"" when possible.  Also, it's not good to have one break when you rely on it like I do.Read more › | Tangle toy // 5.0 // 4 Feb. 2010 // By

 on 18 Feb. 2011 // My 2yr old daugher is totally addicted to Toy Story. We actually had a Buzz and Woody from 1997 when our older children were small, so we hunted them out when she started her addiction to these films. It was her 2nd birthday last week and we wanted to get her something of her own and ordered her this Jessie. Its a bit smaller than the orginal toys but compliments them, it would not be as sturdy as the older ones which have obviously stood the test of time, however she has carried it around with her every day since her birthday and it is still in pretty good shape. Jessie only has a few sayings so it does get repetitive. Initially I thought it was a bit expensive for what it is, however when i see how much my daughter loves it, it was well worth the money. The only thing that really disappointed her about this toy is that it does not have the Name  ANDY on the sole of the boot, as it does in the film and as the other older toys have. But that is a small detail. All in all, a good buy, worth the money for a child who is very into Toy Story. My daughter simply loves it. | A great toy for the young // 5.0 // 24 Dec. 2010 // By

I am unable to comment on the durability as I haven't physically seen the doll-daughter lives in Ireland- and we have only just bought it hence 4 stars ...... but if it is as good as Woody who we purchased many years ago then I would suspect there will be no problems.  Woody was my now 16 year old sons fav toy and has been passed on to my granddaughter - string got broken through misuse at some point but otherwise in great 'well loved' condition :) got a lil faded through sitting on our window sill .... but hey :) again no complaints at all and both worth the money.

So I decided to get this figure to display next to my copies of Batman. The head sculpt of Bruce Wayne is laughable and anyone will tell you this. So stick the Thrasher head on and never...... Never take it off.Solid figure standing 9inches tall. Good weight. Stands well. Ok articulation (all the fingers move independently which is nice).

 on 24 May 2014 // I have to admit to being a little reluctant to buy this initially due to the relatively high ticket price for a single ship/model.  However having decided to bite the bullet I'm incredibly glad I did.  The model itself is huge in dimensions (as it should be) in comparison to the normal fighters, the detail is great and the paint job is suitably weathered and realistic.  So much so you could probably use this in a fan movie if you so desired :)In addition it comes with a wealth of cards and accessories to enhance your game experience and grow upon the basic game.  If this is the quality of epic/capital ships that are going to be released for this game series it will become a massive hit as time goes by, especially with the new movies in the pipeline.I'm looking forward to future releases in this series, although don't go expecting a star destroyer any time soon as if built on the same scale it would be unbelievably huge and no doubt carry a price tag to match :) | Great Value - Buy It! // 5.0 // 22 May 2014 // By

 on 13 Sept. 2015 // A must-buy for any dedicated X-Wing Miniatures player. The detail of the ship model is extraordinary and worth the price even if you buy it as a collector's piece, but the addition of Huge ships totally transforms the X-Wing Miniatures game from a quick-fire tactical game to an epic strategic battle requiring a whole evening to resolve, adding a whole new layer of depth and reward to an already superlative board game. | For experienced players, or those who like models. // 5.0 // 26 July 2015 // By

 on 18 Oct. 2014 // You can't fault the detail and quality of this model, and I love that Fantasy Flight added a couple of larger ships for some variety. Even if you don't play the game this is still a lovely model to display.Where the problems lie are with both the price and it's useability. It's way to expensive, and a little too large to realistically use in a game. The only way you could really use it would be as an objective, a stationary piece of scenery, because most tables I've played on would barely allow this thing to manoeuvre. It also feels a little large, and when I saw the rebel transport next to it (which I had always imagined as a much bigger ship) this dwarfs it! | Not had chance to use it yet but great to display and you can still use cards Now ... // 5.0 // 4 July 2015 // By

 on 5 Jun. 2009 // I've used this kite several times in the last month and it's very easy to fly (once you have enough of a breeze).  If there's a good wind, you can launch it on your own but I've found it easiest in all wind conditions if a friend helps.The hand grips are moulded plastic circles and they are very comfortable to use.  The line attached to the kite with clips, making it easy to set up (you don't need to tie the string to the kite).  It also makes the kite more secure.The only downside is that the kite comes apart very easily on impact.  This is obviously better than parts of it snapping but if you have to retrieve it and put the poles back in place after each (slight) impact, it gets annoying.Overall, this is a good beginner's kite. | WOW what a kite // 4.0 // 29 Nov. 2004 // By

The kite was easy to set up and comes with a good carry case. It comes with good instructions to help you get the best enjoyment out of your kite. After a few disapointing attemps I got the hang of it and it was flying wonderfully. at one point I even had a bit of a crowd. However my moment of fun soon came to an abrupt end when my new kite nose dived into the ground. This I admit is not the falt of the kite it is the falt of the pilot, however the kite did sustain some damage upon impact. The center pole has split and snaped in two. So I am having to replace this with something that is more durable.

I'm pleased to say that they work perfectly with the regular stomp rocket launcher, so you don't need to buy a ""junior"" launcher to go with them if you've already got a regular launcher.They're a slightly snug fit but they still fire a reasonable distance. The fact that they're lighter means they have a shorter range and are less likely to knock things over then they're falling down after hitting the ceiling, but be warned that a direct hit from one of these will still knock over a full cup of coffee!They're supposed to glow in the dark - a neat idea but it doesn't seem to work too well. Not a major drawback though as firing them in the dark could lead to all kinds of breakages... | Buy the stomp rocket! // 5.0 // 26 July 2013 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 26 July 2013 // I've reviewed the actual rocket. Best money ever spent on kids' toys, ever! The refill pack is a necessity as the rockets are not indestructible. Frankly, I think they are expensive when compared to buying the starter kit itself, but hey they're only 4 pounds and the ensemble is a must have for days outside with the kids. If you want to give it some wellie youself, make sure you have plenty of room - the rockets can travel higher than a 4/5 storey building no problem! | Great game // 3.0 // 13 Sept. 2015 // By

#1 HALL OF FAMETOP 10 REVIEWER on 11 Mar. 2011 // I bought this windsock (and a pole from here) as a novelty object for the garden and to give my little nephew something to look at when he plays in the garden! The windsock is a cracker! Well it's a fish to be honest. Anyhow, the fish is approx 1 meter long (100 cm) and is very colourful indeed. The colours are bright and vibrant. The material is ripstop nylon and feels very tough so I imagine will last for ages. The fish looks graet blowing in the wind and can be seen for miles! (well hundreds of yards where I live!) I'm very happy with it and it makes a good addition to the garden as long as there's some wind of course!

The kite will be easy to store answer in the bot with out taking up much more space than a very small fold up kite would do.Brought for my daughters birthday. She is a small 8yo and flew this with no hassles at all. The day we tested was a 7-8mph wind and she kept control at all times.Would I recommend this ? Yes without any shadow of a doubt for a kid, for an adult it's still loads of fun but a larger kite would naturally give you a bit more of a fight.

 on 14 April 2010 // I wanted a first kite for my 2 year old. I already knew box kites were really stable and fly in light winds. This one is very colourful and very easy to launch and fly. It will stay up forever when other single line kites nose dive and crash. My son loved it. It is easy to puncture the fabric when assembling the diagonal spars. I did this with one spar when I first assembled it but have been more careful since. There is just a small puncture in the fabric which isn't noticable and doesn't affect the flying. It also has not got worse despite being also flown in high winds. A very nice kite. | Very stable // 5.0 // 27 Feb. 2011 // By

 on 27 Feb. 2011 // I got this kite to fly alongside my Daughters Diamond Rainbow. We've had it for about a week now but the wind just hasn't been blowing till yesterday, so we all went to try it out. I was expecting to need help getting it into the air but found that all I needed to do was let it go and it rose immediately.The construction of the kite looks and feels very good, everything is tight and solid. seems as though it would be able to handle quite a few fast crashes before anything broke.Assembly was easy as it's just a case of fixing the four cross beams inside into the rubber mounts. care does have to be taken when doing this though as the 2nd beam at each end needs to be bent to get it into the mount so it would be easy to slip and puncture the canvas.Once done though all that's needed is to tie the string on and wait for a windy day. the string has plenty on it too, the picture I've uploaded has the string unwound about halfway.Overall a fun, easy to fly, well made kite that can be launched by one person. | classic box kite // 3.0 // 14 May 2013 // By

 on 14 May 2013 // Item came well packaged and within the time stated.  I read with interest one of the reviews for this particular item from a lady who stated that when putting the item together she inadvertently put a small hole in the sale area from one of the cross members that hold the kite taut.  I now see the reason why this happened. This is because the cross member spars as mentioned are certainly too long and one has to struggle to put them in place without having to bend them in.  I found in my case that I had to alter the length of the  spars by as much as 1cm to get them sit properly without seeing a bend within the cross structure.  I know that it is not probably critical as kites go and I have since flown the kite and found it to be a great flyer, however, I did have to alter the said spars which was not easy to do as they are made of carbon fibre and have to be cut with a junior hacksaw carefully to prevent splitting.  Unless the manufacturer alters the spec. slightly others may have the same difficulty when assembling. | Great kite that doesn't need much wind // 5.0 // 4 Nov. 2010 // By

The cross-braces are slender, and therefore flexible, and when fitted in place become curved by the tension. Some reviewers have suggested shortening the cross-braces a little -this would probably lessen their tendency to bend, but would also reduce the pressure needed to keep the box shape square. I shall leave their lengths as supplied for the time being, and re-assess after having flown the kite. | Great kite! // 5.0 // 23 May 2014 // By

 on 23 May 2014 // Went on a hill  about half a mile from my father in law's house with my family. When the wind was strong enough it went up. It needs a bit stronger wind than other kites to fly. It went soaring upwards and it was easy to handle. It was one of the easiest kites to handle and I have now about 10 in my collection. It went up about 150m up and first door neighbors said they saw it from half a mile away. It would go even higher but I saw a light aircraft flying so I lowered it down. All in all one of the best buys. Just needs moderate wind and off it goes. | Excellent Kite // 5.0 // 24 Aug. 2013 // By

    Yes it has dual lines and each has a coloured material loop to put your hands through. A 6 year old would need assistance/reassurance from behind but they'll still feel they are flying it.

 on 22 Sept. 2013 // I bought this as a gift for a friend and we have spent the afternoon flying it.I have flown delta type rigid stunt kites for many years and I found this kite to handle as well as mine. The principle difference being the lack of poles, which make this much more crash proof!It does all the same types of stunts including tight loops and will fly in far lighter winds than my rigid kites.One thing worth noting that is not mentioned in the instructions: There is a little loop of string on the trailing edge, right in the middle. This serves two purposes. The first is to stow the two knotted ends on the kite where you would attach the lines for flight. This allows you to fold away the kite without the worry of tangled rigging. The second is to attach a really long polyester tube tail and make your stunts look even better!Before flying or gifting this kite I stowed the lines as mentioned above (they come attached to a piece of card, when new). I also unwound the flight lines off the plastic retainer (these are wound as a pair). Then I detached them from the handle straps, separated them, and rewound them individually, one after the other, back on to the handle. This makes the kite more ready to fly, out of the bag, as it is easier to lay the lines one at a time. The lines will otherwise possibly become very tangled on first deployment. Some reviewers on here have had this problem with much frustration it appears. (most new kites have line wound in this fashion, as the lines are in pairs of equal length)This is a superb kite for a nice price. I will be buying more of these as gifts. A bit of preparation prior to wrapping this up will ensure it will deploy and perform out of the bag on it's first flight. | Good entry level Kite // 5.0 // 7 Sept. 2013 // By

 on 3 Aug. 2014 // This is the first kite I have owned and I have to say I loved it. I slammed it into the ground loads of times (as I am a novice) but it was fine. I once used a kite with solid struts, but that just hit the ground once and broke. This one does not do that as there are no solid parts. There is a little vibration when in high wind, but to be honest you will love it as a fun kite for yourself and the children. I will keep this little baby in the car for fun times out. If you have never owned a kite then buy this one. For the money it IS WELL WORTH BUYING!!! I now want a bigger one to see if I can get lifted off the ground!.

 on 20 Jan. 2015 // Got this beauty last week ready for a trip to the coast this weekend - its my 3rd Flexifoil and they are as excellent as ever.  Good to get this when it was reduced.  I think that this is the biggest Sting so its quite a workout but easy and great fun to fly. It's certainly the biggest one I've got.  If you don't know Flexifoil kites are aerofoil kites - so no spars or struts to break as it's a wing shape and is aerodynamically designed.  The whole thing folds or squashes up into the accompanying rucksack.  Easy to get going and easy to put away and I had mine sorted was flying it within a few minutes.  Its a four line kite so you fly it via handles with two strings per handle (top and bottom).  Means you can do multiple loop the loops and 'fly' the kite across the sky really easily.  Also you can 'collapse' the aerofoil by moving the handles forward (or in fact just letting go!) and the kite just crumples and floats back to earth. With a little practice you can also land it upright and ready to fly again with just a tug on the handles.

 on 6 Sept. 2015 // Having previously purchased flexifoil kites in the past I expected this to be of the same high standard and on the whole I am happy with the kite and the way it flies but I was a bit disappointed with the cheap feel to the aluminium handles as my other flexifoil kites have has really solid plastic handles with super grippy rubber on them so kinda feel the aluminium ones are a step back although I'm sure they would work fine but I just use my old handles on my new kite, also the kite killers that strap to your wrists are poorer quality than my older ones as well so wasn't impressed by that either! I just feel when paying top money for what should be a top quality product that's exactly what you should get. | Excellent kite.. let down by the handles // 4.0 // 6 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 6 Mar. 2016 // The kite is fantastic fun and generates decent power even in low winds. The handles provided are, in my opinion, not good enough for the kite and let the overall product down slightly. This was immediately apparent after the first flight out of the box ended badly. I upgraded them to the prolink handles (also from flexifoil) and now I'm a very happy with it. Also worth mentioning, the after sales care from Flexifoil was first class and can't praise them enough for sorting my problem out so quickly and efficiently. If the kite came with the better handles as standard.. 5 stars all day long. Photo is me flying it on the beach in very light winds.. love it! | Simply awesome for a bit of fun // 5.0 // 21 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 21 Jan. 2015 // Firstly the kite came promptly in a well sealed box and once it was unwrapped it was just what i expected from any Flexifoil kite, simply brilliant! really easy to control thanks to its four lines and handles making it safe and really easy to fly, never felt like the kite is out of control even in winds its not really designed for. In addition to its great control this kite is just so much fun!! Me and my girl friend would fly them together and every once in a while we would accidentally crash them in to each other, kites i have had in the past have been damaged by this but these Flexifoil kites come off unscathed and are simply awesome for a bit of fun! | Excellent, Outstanding, Great.....! // 5.0 // 30 Jun. 2015 // By

 on 30 Jun. 2015 // Kite arrived in good time and we'll packaged. I managed to get the lines tangled whilst unpacking but if you follow the instructions (I didn't!) You shouldn't have any problems. Great fun to fly and easy to get the basics if you read the well written guide included. Spent 3 hours out on the first trip ending when a gust of wind made me let go of the handles and the safety system bungee snapped. I emailed flexifoil who sent a new set to me no problems.

Measuring approximately 29cms x 86cms, this tall tree has all sorts of interesting creatures living within its branches. Numbers are clearly printed all the way up the trunk, with a corresponding number of animals next to each one.

Before you start, you can ask your child to find a piece with the number 3 on, or a piece with a red and yellow snake on. When completed, as well as counting the number of animals in each group, you can ask which creatures can fly, which ones have beaks, what noises they make.

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 19 April 2012 // The trouble with little children is that it can be difficult to assess their capability. The information for this jigsaw tells us that its for 3 years onwards and I would say that is fair assessment as the child will definitely need to have a good understanding of numbers, shape and pattern. You're probably thinking that's an obvious statement and it is, but I was hoodwinked by a 19 month old toddler into thinking that she would cope with something this advanced. Guess what - Dad was wrong! There is a marked difference between stuffing shapes into holes, numbers into a famous caterpillar, and the true jigsaw (albeit a large floor jigsaw) that this is. 30 pieces in total, 3 across by 10 high, this is a lovely puzzle that offers lots of activity and questions - they have even put a list on the back of the box as a prompt for us adults (see my photo). Overall the quality is excellent and I can thoroughly recommend it for the right age group! | Another great Orchard puzzle // 5.0 // 30 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 30 Aug. 2014 // My 2.5yr old loves his Orchard jigsaws as they are bright, durable and the pictures are spaced out well over the pieces so there is nearly always a bit of something to find (the wheel, the man's hat, the blue car etc). He is awesome at jigsaws and I love doing them with him as we learn vocabulary, reinforce colours and words he already knows and with this one we are learning to recognise numbers. The puzzle comes with a poster the same size so we have started by putting the puzzle together on top of it until he gets better at identifying the numbers. | Love it // 5.0 // 5 Aug. 2010 // By

 on 24 Sept. 2011 // My son got this for his third birthday and absolutely loves it. The pieces are substantial and of lovely quality. It still looks as good as new. Six months on he is enjoying it even more as he is learning his numbers. The poster which is a picture of the jigsaw is an added bonus and looks lovely in his bedroom. Again every night he points to the numbers which is obviously helping him recognise them as well as count. Overall a lovely jigsaw but educational too. It would make a lovely present for any little boy or girl. | Fun and educational // 5.0 // 16 Dec. 2008 // By

 on 16 Dec. 2008 // My two year-old son adores this puzzle. As with all Orchard puzzles there is a lot going on so the pieces are easily differentiated. My son loves counting all the different animals and putting the numbers in order up the tree. It has been a great way for him to become familiar with written numbers and the order they go in. The pieces are large and easy for small hands to put in place and it comes with a poster which is a bonus. | Great Educational Fun // 5.0 // 27 Jan. 2011 // By

If you haven't got a table that you can continuously devote to your jigsaws or you want to be able to move them from place to place in your home then a Jigboard might be the answer to your prayers. Jigboards take the best features of many different styles of jigsaw board and combine them together to make the ULTIMATE puzzle board.

The fact that the board is rigid means that you can place it on the smallest coffee table and still be able to construct large puzzles without any hassle. Alternatively, a Jigboard can be rested on top of your best dining table or any other shiny surface without the least fear of scratching. The fabric covering keeps the pieces attached to the surface and this, combined with a raised edge around the outside of the board, ensures that individual pieces are never lost. Jigboards can easily be picked up and moved. Furthermore they are light enough to rest on your knee or to make jigsaws in bed. Each board comes complete with a Jigmat that combines together two different materials. One side is the same soft fabric material that covers the board whilst the other side is waterproof plastic. Ordinarily, the Jigmat (plastic side up) completely covers the jigsaw when it is not being worked-on and thus protects the jigsaw puzzle from dust, spillages and the unwanted attention of pets!

 on 7 Dec. 2011 // I wanted a board I could balance on my knees.  All the ones I saw in shops were far too flimsy.This one is made of solid wood completely covered in 'felt' which really grips the jigsaw.  I've had the board almost upright and the puzzle didn't move, so it could feasibly be used in bed.  The felt under the board is designed to prevent scratches on a table, but I find it also helps to stop the board from slipping off my trousered knees.It comfortably holds all the 500 piece puzzles I, personally, possess but if you have any particular favourites size will matter so you may want to check measurements which are, on the flat working space inside the rim, 52 x 40 cm.Pricey, but could well last a lifetime. | Just the job! // 5.0 // 25 Nov. 2012 // By

 on 18 Oct. 2013 // This seems as pictured by Amazon. I'm not an aviation history buff so I don't know what the colours on the wings and fuselage or the number 472035 signify. If anyone could enlighten me I'd be grateful.The scale is 1:72 which seems pretty standard for fighter aircraft in this series. Since most of the models I've purchased recently have been signed on the box collectors items, this is only the second one I have actually opened and examined more closely.We know the propellers are potentially fragile; but apart from that I've been pleasantly surprised how heavy and chunky this plane feels to handle. It is a very good model and comes with a black plastic display stand included. However, It lacks optional undercarriage down, detailed crew, and a certificate of authenticity; all that you would get with Corgi Aviation Archive products.I also wish Corgi would supply some information about the planes history. Unfortunately the Mustang P51D is not featured in the Corgi Haynes series.Also I've just completed a postcard to be sent back to Hornby Hobbies/Corgi for a free information pack but it will be about other products in the range rather than about this model itself. | Bars all melted on delivery, probably the couriers fault ... // 5.0 // 25 Oct. 2014 // By

 on 28 Feb. 2014 // A good little tractor. Bought at Christmas and has been played with quite a lot and is still intact now (including wing mirrors) in March!.. so fairly sturdy. The Cab lifts off so that you can place a small man inside (although doesn't come with any man). At first the cab was a little stiff and I had to lift it off for my son, but the unfortunate thing is that it now comes off quite easily- meaning that if he carries it around by the cab, the body of the tractor sometimes falls on the floor!Overall very pleased though!

VINE VOICE on 8 Oct. 2013 // We bought this as a second birthday present for our son. Other Bruder toys have been passed down to him by his cousins (heavily used but still in great condition) so we knew in advance to expect a high quality brand. This fire truck absolutely hit the mark, he loves it and has played with it every day. We haven't used the water hose a lot (might have to wait till the summer!) but the other moveable parts (ladder etc.) seem to provide more than enough interest.

 on 6 Oct. 2014 // This fire-engine is quite large and looks good, however my 3 year old has managed to break off the door and it is not easy to fix at all (lots of small pieces). The water hose works well and can squirt quite far, but the plastic bit at the end of the hose does come off easily so can get lost as it is quite small (easy to put back on though). The ladder is not so easy to extend as you have to push quite hard on the plastic piece while pulling so is a struggle for and adult to do (there was no instructions on how to do this so had to scratch our heads for a while before we figured it out). The noises are good and not too loud and it does come with another set of light covers so those can also get lost if you make the mistake of showing your 3 year old how to change them. I got this toy thinking it would last, however was sadly mistaken as my boy broke the door after 6 months. | Fabulous as ever // 5.0 // 30 May 2013 // By

    I'm afraid that I'm unable to help you with this as we only purchased Take and Play and don't have any Trackmaster items to compare with it.  However, I would mention that the Take and Play, whilst very popular with my toddler, is a bit annoying as a collectable set.  I have 3 different Take & Play sets and they are all slightly different which makes it awkward to connect them together.  It can be done but the set width & track guages are slightly off.  Sloppy planning by the designers/manufacturers who really missed a trick here.  That being said, my 2 year old enjoys playing with it. Hope this helps.

 on 6 Sept. 2012 // I have been planning a Christmas Tree train set for a couple of years and this year decided to plan early. Having a 2 year old I didn't want to take spend much as there is a fair chance he will get his hands on it.I took the plunge on this set and a well packaged parcel turned up a couple of days later. On first inspection the track is a nice slightly flexible plastic and a big 1.8m circumference circle. The loco is pretty weighty for a plastic train and after popping the batteries in it ran very nicely around the track.All in all this is a nice set and well worth the money. | Good Value // 4.0 // 25 Dec. 2013 // By

My son was able to assemble the track easily and loved it.

He loves playing with it and spends all day arranging tracks, offloading cargo etc. Brio is such a durable and clever system. For this reason he will have this set to pass onto his own kids.

It works as a clockwork train as well as remote control, which is a bonus as the wee one can switch it on and off and put it into reverse himself when he cant get the remote off his Papa. Personally I wish they made a more retro version, and one slight quibble is that the passenger carriage doesn't go through the tunnels when the passenger is on board as her arms stick out the side of the carriage (unsure if tunnel is Brio). The sound effects and headlights are good.Original (duracell plus) battery still working after 7 hours use, though will need changed soon as the engine is starting to struggle up the slopes with carriages attached. | Weak performer on the slopes // 2.0 // 1 Jan. 2014 // By

The control goes forward, backwards, faster, switches the lights on and off and makes a choo choo noise. You have to make sure the little red semi circle on the control is pointing at the train for it to work well though. It goes up and down hills with ease and other carriages from other trains can be attached. Looks really good with its little lights on in the dark!

 on 16 Jun. 2013 // I purchased these for my son to go along with the Thomas he got with one of the take-and-play range tracks and he loves them. Being aged 2 they have been dropped, thrown, dunked in water and used for flying practice off the dining room table, always surviving without a dent or scratch even after 6 months.The carriages are good quality and well painted with great detailing, and are a must for anyone looking to get the take-and-play range. However I wouldn't purchase for a younger child as they are metal and quite heavy, there are other Thomas & Friends ranges that would suit someone smaller (my son has a rubber Percy bath toy for example, that he used to suck when he was younger). | Annie and Clarabel // 1.0 // 21 Feb. 2014 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 15 Sept. 2011 // If you have the take n play Thomas, you have to get the Annie and Clarabel carriages to go with him don't you? Fans of the 1980's version of the show will remember them well, though sadly, they don't seem to play much of a starring role in the new animated one. The carriages, like the engines from the take n play range, are die cast metal with magnets front and back to allow them to be coupled up to Thomas or indeed any other engine from the excellent take n play range.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Tootally Thomas"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£40.00""}}"

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 12 Aug. 2010 // I was initially a bit confused over the main difference between the 'Take and Play' and the 'Take Along' range as both use the same type of trains and track. But it seems that Take and Play is more portable in so far as it folds up easier and contains less parts, perhaps it will replace the Take Along range.Anyway, this play set is a fun track - the magnetic items can be hoisted up and lowered using the little crank. The oval track isn't very big but it has a bridge to add some interest, but of course the set can be connected up to any other track in the Take Along/Take and Play range. Cranky is telescopic and simply pushes down into itself to allow the track to fold around it and form an easy to carry bundle. The Salty Engine included can be stored under the bridge and is held in place by the track when folded. This comes with a little cargo-boat too which is a nice addition and allows for even more imaginative play.The oval track isn't made of individual pieces, it is one hinged piece - that makes this incredibly easy to set up and put away. This is perfect to grab and take out if you want to keep your little occupied for a while, you can be fairly certain that you won't lose essential bits!In a nutshell: This is a small Thomas track but it still provides a fair amount of play value. A great toy to take out of the house when young ones may get a bit bored - and a great toy to use at home in conjunction with any other tracks they may have. | A great improvement on the older model. // 5.0 // 10 Mar. 2011 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 24 Sept. 2015 // The most interactive of the Tane and Play sets that I've seen, this one works really well. The crane extends to a decent height, the hook winds up and down, the boom lifts and the hook even has a decent strength magnet in it so that it can pick up the supplied barrels. The signal/barrier is a nice feature that acts to hold the kit together when in ""take"" mode and gives something else to interact with when in ""play"" mode.My only gripe is the fact  poor old Cranky can collapse without too much pressure, and there's been many an occasion where our little one has been leaning on the crane only to have it ""telescope"" back down to it's shortest setting. Over time I expect this will become more frequent as the p[lastic wears and friction doesn't do as good a job of holdding it up. It would have been nice if there was a simple locking mechanism that kept things standing tall.All things considerd, it's highly recommended. | A big hit // 5.0 // 27 July 2011 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 27 July 2011 // Cranky is very popular with my 3 year old son and any visiting children make a bee line for him.  As well as the Cranky the crane himself, you get Salty (a diecast engine), two magnetic barrels and a plastic boat. The hook at the end of the crane contains a magnet so it can pick up engines or barrels. Cranky works quite well as a stand alone toy but also connects with up with other sets eg the bridges and tunnels set Thomas the Tank Engine Bridges & Tunnels Set - NEW or with other Take n Play toys. Don't buy wooden engines to go with it though as they are slightly bigger than the diecast ones and don't fit through the shed. When fully extended it is quite a sizeable toy, but I love how easily and neatly it folds it all away - push Cranky back down, fold the two sides of the track back up and secure with the red catch. The catch can be tricky for a child to open at first, but they seem to get the hang of it soon enough. | Tracks sealed on back to front // 5.0 // 4 Jan. 2013 // By

 on 4 Jan. 2013 // I wasn't impressed that the tracks were assembled to the central unit upside down and they were a nightmare to take part by forcing a metal pin out on each side of the track with a lot of brut force to pull apart and put back together again. Also the cranky crane does not lock together very well when you extend the telescopic tower that it stands on. The one good thing is the crane rope on this is quite strong and the magnetic hook lifts up the cargo but you'll need to get buy some additional pieces to make it entertaining. My son likes it all the same but I think you can do better with some other take along/take and play sets. | Very good at compacting down and comes with salty // 4.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By

 on 26 Oct. 2014 // We are big fans of take n play sets in our household and my nosy love cranky, however now we have owned this for a while, the red little lever is very stiff and is a job for my 3 year olds to turn to get him to lift things up and down with his crane. It is definitely one of the best for packing away and compacting down. Cranky at his maximum height is in 3 sections that lift up and the sides lift up and lock into place also so very good for packing away. Also excellent to see a set not come with a Thomas. This one comes with Salty the diesel. All in all would buy again as you definitely can't have a Sodor without a cranky! | What a great toy // 5.0 // 2 Sept. 2012 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 22 Nov. 2015 // This is one of the newer model Tane-and-Play toys, identifiable by the round magnets. The older models (with the square magnets) tend to be bigger and have more detailed die-cast components. This is certainly true for Hiro - disappointingly, in this version of Hiro all of the ""detail"" is painted on, and will quickly succumb to the knocks and scratches of day-to-day play.It's a nice engine and what take and play set would be complete without a Hiro, but it's a shame to see the quality of the toys declining so noticeably, when the price remains the same. It's worth looking on e-Bay for some of the older models - you can pick them up cheaper and they're better made as well. | One of the engines which comes with a wagon, I love this one // 5.0 // 24 Sept. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 3 Nov. 2015 // The Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Thomas engine is a representation of the popular Thomas character from The Railway Series for use as part of a wooden railway collection.  It is an acceptably made model, connecting well and with sound enough design to be played with regularly by small hands.  The paintwork is accurate and clear, the facial depiction a good impression of the character from the TV show.Unfortunately the design is poor.  The model is oversized.  It does not fit into some features of wooden railway collections because it is just too tall.  This is surprising as Thomas is supposed to be a small tank engine yet this model is much taller than models from the same series such as Gordon the Big Engine.  A surprising design decision that impacts play.  Thomas can't go through for instance the BRIO metro tunnel and gets stuck when attempting to go through the quarry tunnel made by the Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Company - the same people who made this Thomas model.This is frustrating for play.  Thomas is the ubiquitous face of the the children's train genre even though he was never really the main feature of the original series of books.  Making him the wrong size is a real disappointment. | Genuine article! // 5.0 // 1 Jan. 2016 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 31 Jan. 2015 // Thomas & Friends, Take-n-Play, Rattling Rails is a portable play-set requiring adult assembly. No tools required. The pieces click together and it's really simple to do. Even better; no batteries are required and I'm all for that!.The idea behind the set is to find a missing snake who has slithered away from the new Snake Ride Exhibit. To do this Thomas has to ride the 'Snake Ride'. He sits in the snakes mouth and rides up and down or races through a loop. Movement is controlled by a simple lever mechanism. The snakes tail forms a carry handle.The toy is very lightweight, 975 gms, and quite small, approx. 38.1 x 10.2 x 27.9 cm, so easy for children to move around.As an added extra there are two collectable figures included; die-cast metal snake and Thomas the Tank engine.Well made, colourful toy that holds it's shape and isn't too wobbly if kept on a hard, flat surface. The idea behind it is quite basic though, they're just moving a snake up and down, and the danger is the novelty will soon wear off unless Rattling Rails is connected to additional train tracks/accessories. Good starting point if you want to collect Thomas the Tank toys.Nice for children to carry around in one piece and not have to keep taking it apart and putting it back together.Suitable for 3+ years and comes with a warning that the set contains magnets ""..don't use around items that are sensitive to or affected by magnetic fields.."".Happy to recommend. Three year old great-nephew loves it and felt very grown up carrying the set round to his friend's house. Worth 4* just for that. | Repetitive and lacking in any extra entertainment value. // 3.0 // 9 Feb. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 9 Feb. 2015 // This Thomas set is very well made and is on par with the usual quality of Thomas the tank engine products. It is, as these sets usually are, to a different scale from others, but there are track extensions you can purchase to increase your take and play Thomas world, but of course it is always extra outlay.This is basically a lever operated toy, where you place Thomas in the head of the snake, push down the lever and the snake head rotates up and around the centre, taking Thomas up to the track, where he then rolls back down into the snake head at the bottom, and you repeat. There isn't really much more to it than that and whilst it is fun at first, it does not really maintain a child's attention after several repeats and I believe it gets quite boring to be honest.I also feel that whilst it has a carry handle, it is still quite a bulky piece to carry around and there is nowhere to put Thomas to carry him with the track, so he has to be carried separately anyway, so it is not a carry all solution and is overplaying it's ""take and play"" image just a little bit.So, over all, it is a toy that will entertain your child for a short while, but it's repetitive nature will quickly become boring, it has no sounds, which may be nice for parents, but just makes it less entertaining to me. | The novelty wears off rapidly // 2.0 // 4 Feb. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 4 Feb. 2015 // After an initial leap of excitement from our three-year-old, we were quickly left a bit underwhelmed by this toy. The novelty wore off quickly- it is a ""one trick"" toy, basically it's just a lever, and once you've used the lever a few dozen times, there really isn't much more to enjoy in it.Thinking about the plusses... it's well made and sturdy, and light-weight. The Thomas figure is a nice little object in itself, and can obviously be played with on its own. The fact no batteries are involved is always a bonus- it means it can't make any annoying repetitive noises.Having not seen the recent Thomas movie (assuming it's connected to that), I'm afraid I don't see the connection between Thomas the Tank Engine and a giant snake ride anyway. It's like they got confused between Thomas The Tank Engine and Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom. It doesn't seem to make any sense story-wise even as a ""Snake Ride Exhibit"".I think the ""take-n-play"" aspect is a bit overstated as well. Yes this toy is marginally easier to carry around than some other toys, because of the fact you can use the lever handle as a carry handle, but you still have to carry around the Thomas engine. Making a major sales point out of the fact that it's moderately easy to carry seems like scraping the barrel a bit.We already have one Thomas rail toy- part of the Trackmaster set- and this is a completely different scale, so there's no compatibility between the two (we understood this already, but our three-year-old found that a bit confusing).Read more › | Rather disappointing... // 3.0 // 2 Mar. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 2 Mar. 2015 // My three year-old son is obsessed by everything Thomas and was beaming from ear to ear when this arrived for him. It was very quick to assemble and easy for a small boy to operate (you push down the handle to make the serpent swing round the central pole) however there were a couple of disappointments . Firstly despite the fact the train track looks remarkably similar to our plastic Thomas and friends train set (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thomas-Friends-Trackmaster-Motorised-Train/dp/B00404FLTM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425285265&sr=8-1&keywords=thomas+train+set) it doesn't actually connect to it and although it appears to have been designed with the intention of connecting to additional parts of a train track, I can't find anything Amazon stocks that would seem to connect, so therefore it only works as a stand alone.The second disappointment was that this was a very short lived novelty. My son played with it for about 10 minutes and then after that it has just been moved around his round and no longer played with. I also have to add that it just seems a really bizarre concept. I'm not quite sure where a serpent actually fits in to the Thomas stories or why this one swings round a pole.My advice? You are better off spending your money on buying some of the lovely wooden Thomas and friends trains (always a hit with my son) to rather than this plastic 5 minute novelty!","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Buy-For-Less-Online"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£18.09""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""It's All Fun & Games"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£18.65""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Coolest Bargains"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£20.00""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""a1 Toys"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£22.79""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""GLOBAL SOLUTIONS"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£22.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Duncans Retail"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£23.37""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""ToyWarehouseUK"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£23.49""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Debenhams"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£20.00""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""Tullabeg Toys"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£20.99""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""Latest Bargains"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£23.99""}]}"

 on 19 Aug. 2010 // Just bought this for my son who is train/car obsessed. Very impressed, lots of track, 3 bridges, 2 levels, a tunnel, station and crane, plus lots of trains/other vehicles, trees and houses. Required some screwing to assemble, but straightforward and clear instructions how to set up. Quite large when assembled, planning to make a play table to keep it on. Other standard trains we already had fit on very well also. | Great BRIO compatible train set // 4.0 // 18 Feb. 2009 // By

 on 18 Feb. 2009 // I have purchased this over Christmas at a great price (almost 2/3 off!) and it has proven a great success with the little ones (and the grown ups). We have extented the set with a couple of other BRIO compatible sets and managed to create a very enjoyable toy.The product is only let down by the lack of bulding instructions or examples. You have to use your imagination (which is stimulating for the kids i agree!) or try to mirror the design on the box, but that proved challenging..Enjoy! | Top, top train set // 4.0 // 3 May 2013 // By

 on 3 May 2013 // This is a top quality train set! You can add to it and the pieces are sturdy. Negative points are minimal but the wooden beading on the box came off very easily and because it's a sliding lid, the support on one side of the box also broke early on. It could also do with having more straight track pieces for when your child wants to make his/her own track layout. | I love it // 5.0 // 21 Feb. 2013 // By

It cost around £3-4, but its detail and quality were far above the average die-casts. My son absolutely loved it and played with it relentlessly. The truck sustain the abuse although eventually the hinges of the tipper door broke. At this point I looked online and purchased this set that I found very reasonably priced. Surely enough, the quality of the rest of the vehicles matched that of the garbage truck. They have all been well played although again the garbage truck hinges have suffered some damage.

    Yes a 7 year old will be able to play this. The skill is planning your moves to catch the opponent by surprise. Similar to chess in strategy but the pieces are much simpler to move. It's good for children because it's visual. I.e. They can see the light bouncing off little mirrors and can plan its next bounce.

 on 17 July 2008 // An excellent purchase that I'm very pleased with. The game is well designed, the instructions are clear and precise enough to get playing straight away.The complexity of the game is well pitched so that you can pick up the basics straight away, making it very accesible, but the level of strategy is deep enough so that you will develop new tricks and moves along the way to increase it's longevity.It's also incredibly addictive, which is not bad thing as it challenges you to use your brain power not only to plot your own moves, but to try to counteract your opponent also.There are several different starting positions, each with varying balance between attack and defence. Having played the game a number of times I'm confident to say that it does not seem to get repetitive, and game rarely follow the same pattern. The ""Eye of Horus"" add on is a great purchase, slightly expensive for an extra 2 pieces, but adds a real depth of extra gameplay options.The only slight criticism I have, echoed in one of the previous reviews, is that the pieces aren't quite as robust and precisely made as they could be, there are occasions when the beam can become slightly off centre which means that it may not take the correct course at longer ranges.HOWEVER - With a bit of care, you can combat this - Take a few moments ""testing"" each piece at a distance from the beam, if you carefully press the mirrors one way or the other you can seem to ""settle"" them and align them better. If you do find that the beam is slightly out of line during a game, and can't settle the mirrors, try swapping the piece that seems to be affecting the beam's trajectory with another of the same pieces on the board.Read more › | Fantastic Game let down by Quality of Manufacture // 4.0 // 19 Feb. 2008 // By

 on 19 Feb. 2008 // The concept of Khet is a brilliant strategy game uising lasers. You really need to know your angles of reflection to enjoy this. The fact that there are add on features to the basic pack (which is great in itself) incluing the extra Pillar make this an enduring masterpiece. It is fun and very easy to understand and pick up, may take a while to master and no two games should be the same.However, sadly it is rather let down by the quality of its manufacture. When using mirrors to reflect a beam of light around a board (some pieces even split the light for more fun); you need to be pretty accurate in both quality of the pieces and materials used. Unfortunately this is not the case with Khet, which concidering the price; you would expect. When using pieces like the 'Eye of Horus' (beam splitter), you need to mark out the path of the beams manually and this can get quite complicated especially if the beam is reflected off the board or somewhere it shouldn't be.Basically this is down to the simple fact that any divence of the beam to the norm; no matter how small to start with; will get worse each time the beam is bounced from piece to piece.Never the less: A Great Game just let down by 'some' shoddy workmanship and Quality Control.I would still recommend it. | great but cheaply made // 3.0 // 23 April 2012 // By

 on 23 April 2012 // The concept of this game is great and is educational too. ...I have enjoyed playing it but the quality of the manufacture lets its donw in my case.The mirror angles are out on some pyramids meaning you have wayward lasers.The laser piece has a loose top whch means it satys on unless you fiddle with it to stay off.All in all I am disappointed with this purely becuas eof the quality of manufacture. | Very disappointed // 1.0 // 10 Mar. 2012 // By

 on 10 Mar. 2012 // This game sounds like fun.  Unfortunately, I never got to find out.  I have had to return this twice because of defaults.In both cases the Sphinx laser projector/pointer did not function correctly.  First time around, the red sphinx's laser was really dull, and the silver one only worked intermittently.  I returned the first one and asked for a replacement.  This time the silver sphinx's laser did not function at all.  I will be avoiding this game now, as I am not convinced of the build quality.These were the last two that amazon had remaining in stock, and both were faulty.  Having now returned both, I notice that amazon's stock has gone up by two.

 on 25 Mar. 2014 // The fact I've given this game 4 stars despite the weak manufacturing is a testament to how much fun it is - mentally taxing like chess - but more accessible and, let's face it, much cooler.Unfortunately, the good news ends there. Only buy Khet 2.0 if you can take inevitable design flaws in your stride and still enjoy the good game that lies underneath. As other reviews have mentioned, the lasers do not reflect correctly at larger distances. Manufacturing for light reflection needs to be perfect - and it is not.Each piece should be at an exact 45 degree angle in order to reflect the light 90 degrees. It is probably true to say that the errors on each piece are fractional; but cumulatively, the error will become large (by the order of a few degrees). At large distances, this equates to the laser missing the piece it is supposed to hit entirely, taking out a fundamental element of the game. The pieces cannot easily be corrected.It seems to work at shorter distances, or with less reflections, so the game isn't entirely ruined - and when it does go wrong, you just have to study the route the beam should take, and explain it to your opponent. Not quite as much fun this way...","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£24.49""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Shop4World"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£27.95""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Asgard Games UK"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£24.00""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Boardgames4usUK"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£29.55""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""Lazy Juggler"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£29.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Games Lore Ltd"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£34.05""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""PDK Toys, Games & Music"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£34.09""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Yachew LTD"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£56.59""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""M and N Media US"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£43.80""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""MEGA-MAG"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£82.45""}]}"

 on 17 Nov. 2011 // My 4 year old son is very pleased with his birthday present.  He wanted Woody to play with his bubble bath Buzz so they went in the bath together!!!  His Dad took out his batteries and dried all by heater and Woody still works fine so it is quite well made.  Little bit pricey but you obviously get what you pay for. | Excellent Woody // 5.0 // 11 Nov. 2011 // By

 on 11 Nov. 2011 // I bought this Woody direct from the Disney Store for £25 plus postage. This Woody is the correct size (i.e. as in the Films) and is excellent quality. He has all the best sayings like ""There's a snake in my boot!"" and has in infectious laugh. Yes he is not as functionally rich as the Woody from the Toy Story Collection (my eldest son's Christmas present), but I think he is a close second and is brilliant nonetheless. Certainly better than the Toy Story 3 Woody that is currently for sale! | Good quality // 4.0 // 15 May 2014 // By

 on 15 Feb. 2013 // I would definitely recommend this product to any Legend of Zelda fan with enough money to buy it! It's a brilliant figurine for play, display, or photography, and is made to a very high quality!The body of this figma is astounding, the skirt of Link's tunic is made of a softer flexible plastic, meaning you can pose his legs without it getting in the way. The legs and feet themselves are rather sturdy, and he's very capable of standing even without his stand. The arms are also of equal good quality. His joints are easy to move freely, and won't pop out unless you force them, and despite my expectations, his adaptable hat actually looks very effective in photographs.The interchangeable pieces all work brilliantly. The expressions are exactly like the actual Link in-game, and his sword and shield will fit into either hand and onto his back, and there's even a second place to attach his stand whilst he's wearing sword and shield. The effect for his sword works brilliantly and looks amazing in photographs.The only real issue I have with this figure is that his sword is not easy to fit into his hand. I read about many people on-line who tried to pop open the sword or to force it into Link's hand, and ended up breaking the sword (which is very thin and could easily break). The way I solved this issue was I ran Link's sword-holding hand under hot water until the plastic softened, opened up the grip a little more, than ran it under cold water to set it. This makes slipping the sword in and out of hand much easier.Overall, a brilliant quality action figure, and definitely worth the money you pay for it, just be careful with his sword! | Link comes alive! // 5.0 // 15 May 2013 // By

 on 15 May 2013 // Good things+ very good craftsmanship, looks exactly like Link from Zelda: Skyward Sword+ excellent materials, giving it a nice fell especially the tunic+ highly pose-able, can stand on its own most of the time+ good accessories, especially the sword & shieldBad things- visible joints (the arm one in particular)- rigid fingers, needs soaking in hot water before making it hold the sword or shieldOverall an excellent figurine and a must have for any Legend of Zelda fan, for me it was worth its (expensive) price. | Master sword More like master piece // 5.0 // 9 Mar. 2015 // By

 on 9 Mar. 2015 // This figure is one nice figure. Excellently built and has solid articulated limbs. The paint job is fantastic and the arm to hold link in place is sturdy and dosnt feel cheap. The spare hands are held in a small piece of plastic which is nice and ""handy"" also comes with a small bag. The small details are brilliant especially the master sword and shield. If your after a link figure this is the figure to have! | Very nice! // 5.0 // 8 April 2013 // By

 on 14 Feb. 2015 // I've only just started to collect these figures, and this Link figma is a perfect addition to any collection! I ordered it a while ago, but it came within the dates given for delivery and I am very impressed.It is so detailed and has so many moveable parts so you can make a number of different poses for him. It comes with two different faces, ten different hands, a shield, a sword, a scabbard for the sword, spare hair, a blue effect to go on the sword and make it look as though he is doing a skyward strike, and, finally, a moveable stand to keep him upright in his dynamic poses.The only thing I have a problem with is the fact the handle of the sword is quite thin and it broke from the sword. This may have been partially my fault, of course, and it has been stuck back on with super glue, but it's just a warning to any buyers that some parts are delicate and you need to be careful.I put him in a different pose all the time and I am very impressed with this purchase!

 on 1 Jan. 2016 // We were surprised to receive these Hulk fists! My middle son is a huge Hulk fan and found my wife's phone and used the 1Click service... we had no idea until we signed for them and then looked at our statement :) Lesson learned!Needless to say our son was thrilled... and so were we. These Hulk fists have brought many a laugh to our home and we all dish out some playful Hulk love from time to time.The gloves fit adult hands and child's hands (my son was 4 when he got them) and there is a useful grip on the inside of them to hold onto.They have worn well and are still as good as new even though my sons play with them regularly. The material is soft and does not tear or deform. The fist just springs back into place.I particularly love the realistic veins... and the colour of the Hulk hands is awesome... hahaIf you are a Hulk fan then these are a lot of fun - though we did wince at the price at the time.

 on 25 Feb. 2015 // Bought for my youngest grand-daughter, who is totally gorgeous and B&H mad !. Her big sister has the original B&H Thistle Castle playset, which had quite small bits. This one is better for the younger child, and offers good play value. The throne is simply moved up and down, so nothing spectacular, so we say a spell, or "" Abracadabra "" , or "" Woohoo.. magic ! "" as we move it. The treasure box is a nice touch though the "" trick "" is easy to spot even for little ones. The cauldron revolves the picture on the wall, which is good but my grand-daughter likes the slide bit best.

Hope this helps | does it actually suck them up? // Hi Sarah ... no ... unfortunately it doesn't. Very misleading as the tv advert shows them being sucked up !! You have to put them in the tube and hold it up.Hope this helps | Does it actually suck them up // Hi Sarah, it has segments of plastic which when you push down on the trashie it goes inside the clear tube.. Then you left the tube up and the trashie falls inside the truck and not back out the tube as the segments stop it from coming out..

 on 24 Jun. 2010 // I bought two other shopping trolleys before this one - the first a plastic ELC one was rubbish - the wheels fell off every two minutes. The second a wire one from Letterbox was so flimsy my 2 year old could bend it with one hand! But this is just brilliant - sturdy, exactly like the real thing with a lovely seat for teddy or doll. The swivel wheels mean its moves freely. My daughter loves it and we take it shopping with us - I have a big trolley and my daughter has hers. The smiles we get from other shoppers and the enjoyment my daughter gets makes shopping a breeze. Way better than any other similar toy and worth the extra expense for the durability.

A few people said it was an odd gift, but he loves pushing it around. He plays with it loads. As he's got older (he's now 3) he has started imaginative play at home and the trolley comes into its own-we 'go shopping' around the kitchen n living room and fill it with different things.He's taken it to Asda and Sainsburys and the local co-op ande very time we get comments about how fantastic it is. People stop me to ask where I got it from. Absolutely worth the cost, it's a solid structure. Highly recommended for sure. | A robust toy // 5.0 // 12 Nov. 2010 // By

 on 8 Dec. 2015 // Purchased Oct 2015, Reveiwed Dec 2015Purchased this for my 5 year old son who loves to go shopping with me :DI did consider buying this some time ago, but I didn't only because I feared it would be a waste of money... now that we have it, I wish I had bought it sooner. My son loves it, and he loves doing the shopping with it too.It definately makes him happier to be more involved in the big monthly shop (or bi-weekly smaller shopping depending where we go lol).Not that my son was a rascal before, but now he is even more well behaved than before and he loves the attention he gets when using it lol.Now some people will buy this only to be used at home... that's great too if you have a lot of space, but we chose not to do this for this trolley as my son used his previous plastic one at home to store things in.. and we have storage boxes for that purpose :)Anyway, this is very well made and very sturdy indeed.Now upon putting it together I first wondered why the trolley basket doesn't extend all the way to the front of the wheels just like on a full suze trolley, but afterwards I found it to be perfect as it leaves enough space for the parent to put your foot down on it to stop it from moving (like a brake). Which is great for making sure your child doesn't run off pushing the trolley all over the place if you don't want them too :DThe other thing is the actual size of the basket... now it may look a little small in our eyes, but it's a good size for kids to put things in without it getting to heavy (which would also enable the brakes) and believe me, my son knows how to organise his shopping to put the most in it as possible lol.Oh and one last thing....Read more ›","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£43.99""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Buy-For-Less-Online"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£48.88""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Little Pumpkin Baby Boutique"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£49.99""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Hello Baby"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£54.10""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""Ideabright Ltd"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£48.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Taufgeschenke-Direkt"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£54.76""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""Kids Republic"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£60.78""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""TOYLAND PARMA"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£53.82""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""CRAZY-GAMES"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£49.75""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""Carousel Shop"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£59.99""}]}"

 on 4 Aug. 2015 // The product itself is great for pretend play. My 3 yr old loves it, especially the chip and pin card reader. The pretend money is a bit rubbish and there wasn't enough of it. The pretend food was just ok. The tins are not too bad, but the boxes are flimsy and already in my recycling bin.The main problem with this product is the plastic cord that attaches the till to the card reader. The cord is a few feet long and there is no breakaway safety feature.After I found my son with the cord around his neck, I cut the cord off. It's not needed and it serves no purpose. I don't know what Casdon was thinking by adding the cord. I suggest anyone who buys this to cut the plastic cord off ASAP. | Grandchildren are already fighting over it! // 5.0 // 18 Sept. 2013 // By

 on 30 April 2014 // Our 3 year old son loves this and so from that point of view we can't argue, if he is happy, we are happy.  The till is a nice item and great for playing shops though I'm glad I didn't pay more than I did.  The till has an electronic till sound that rings when ever the till is opened but is so quiet you really have to listen for it.  The chip and pin section was good though only lasted a few weeks and despite checking the batteries, no longer seems to work, I liked the idea that there were two credit cards though each with a different pin number.  The till also has a small roll of paper in it that acts as a receipt though our son gave that a tug and pulled the whole reel out so that didn't last long.  The empty boxes of food items are a nice touch and added to the fun of the item though the money isn't very realistic so we purchased some Sterling play money separately to go with it.  The only reason it gets a 4 rating and not a 3 is because of the sheer play value. Despite its issues it is a great toy and a great learning aid into learning about money. | Chip 'n' pin Till // 5.0 // 21 Aug. 2009 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 27 Dec. 2012 // I find it quite humbling that this Christmas the two run-away most popular toys at my house were this sweet shop and a Penguin Pile Up Game rather than the games consoles and expensive Disney tie-ins which are relentlessly advertised on TV.To start with the sweet shop needs to be constructed, this takes less than a minute and the side and scales just press on, they can then be removed eaily for storage if required. The set comes with some lollipops and a bag of sweets, enough to fill the 2 plastic jars and the trays. It also comes with plastic coins and some paper money. My kids love roleplaying, be it schools, shops, or princesses (bizarrely my 3 year old boy looks great in the dress my daughters put him in) and this shop has given literally hours of entertainment over the last couple of days. To add to the experience I also purchased sweetie bags and some stainless steel tongs for picking up the sweets and dropping them into the bags - these extras cost little over £3 and help turn this from a great toy into an awesome one!In a nutshell: The success of a toy has the be measured in play value - and this has not disappointed. Cynics may think that kids would just scoff the sweets, but once the novelty of the sweets wears off they realise that the sweets are an important resource in order for this to work and they manage to keep enough in circulation! Obviously the sweets are easily replaced, I've got a tub of Jelly Babies on stand by. | Casdon Toy Sweet Shop // 4.0 // 30 Dec. 2009 // By

 on 30 Dec. 2009 // Purchased this for my 4 year daughter who loves sweets and the whole concept of owning her own sweet shop.  Was delivered really fast and unlike one of the reviews I read prior to purchasing this, the two sweet jars do have lids which open and close and therefore are able to be used.  A really good buy and my only complaint was that the lollys provided were slightly sticky! | Great shop // 5.0 // 31 Mar. 2012 // By

 on 8 Jan. 2014 // Bought for my 2 year old grand daughter to complete her shop.  Read other reviews and saw that some customers had received item with sweets , whereas others had received shop without .Warned my daughter , in advance ,  and she found the sweets tucked away within a separate compartment within the package .Had visions of my grand  daughter having a bean feast before the shop was even set up.My daughter has replaced the sweets with chunky dry pasta shapes and with raisins and dried fruit as dolly mixtures are way too sweet and full of colours.  The shop was well received and the scoop and jars have given lots of fun .

 on 18 Jan. 2014 // I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she has been playing with it ever since. She eats some of the goods but loves weighing and putting the other stuff in small bags. I have added my own selection of mini treats too. It is great for role play and a lot of vocabulary is extended and developed too. | Good wee toy // 3.0 // 4 Nov. 2014 // By

 on 4 Nov. 2014 // Good wee toy. Bought for Xmas present. Only criticism would be the scales. Once I had put them together, felt that they were too wobbly - to the extent that the little tray was easily knocked off. So I decided to make an adjustment to the tray, by gluing two pieces of rubber band to the bottom of it, which makes it more stable, when positioned on the scales.  I also bought the pink striped bags and extra tongs. | You don't get the sweets! // 3.0 // 21 Nov. 2011 // By

Lots for little people to learn and great fun with the scanner, microphone, card payment machine, cash register, and so on. An instant hit with the 2yo it was purchased for - even up against some other fantastic and engaging birthday presents. The coins are small so something to be aware of, but everything else seems a decent/safe size.Only two very small niggles:1. The cable on the scanner is very short so not always very convenient for scanning.2. The whole unit is very light which means pushing the cash tray back in really requires two hands - one to push and one to hold the rest of the unit in place. | fun, fun, fun // 5.0 // 30 Jan. 2013 // By

    Hi Sarah,  I think it is meant to be left standing as you have to loosen the allan key screws to flatten the frame - I suspect this is to prevent the kids from flattening it and getting their fingers trapped.  When the fittings are tightened, the stand is very robust and secure.  Having said that, we now have to rotate toys due to lack of space, and the market stand does pack away easily.  The top just lifts off and rolls up, the slats just lift off the shelves and, using the allen key to loosen the fittings, the main frame does collapse.  So in answer to your question, if you keep the allen key close by and don't mind loosening and re-tightening it, then yes.  However, the stand looks so gorgeous with the crates of fruit and veg on it it is a shame not to have it on display.  Thanks,Cathy

 on 18 Jan. 2011 // Our three year old son wants to be a farmer at the moment and is very into his tractors etc.  We started buying the wooden fruits and vegetables which he would load into his tractor trailer and make some pocket money selling it to friends & family.  His collection got so big we decided it was time to branch out into full market trading.We bought this market stand which is a lovely way of displaying his fruit & veg, and keeps it all tidy and together.  He loves filling his crates up and counting things out for people buying from his stall, and counting the money he gets, so its very educational.Yes, it doesn't come with any fruit/veg but that is clearly stated, and yes you do have to assemble it but if you take a few moments to scan the instructions its very simple.  It is lovely quality and is very stable and durable if you tighten the fixings up properly.You could say it is a little expensive for what is essentially a shelving unit, but I bought it on Amazon much cheaper than it was for sale in my local wooden toy shop.  Also, if you know like me that the crates of good quality fruits and vegetables cost between £10 and £15 each, I suppose the manufacturers think parents will bear this cost.All in all I am very happy with the product and would recommend it.

 on 6 Jan. 2016 // Product is a laugh and pretty good quality.Only two faults are:Sweep's squeak is weak and to use it you have to sacrifice two finders with the consequence of not being able to control both his hands.Sooty's wand is in an odd position and is permanently attached. A detached wand with a Velcro hand would probably have been a better idea though I acknowledge this would put the cost up.Overall though, would recommend for a laugh. | Terrific puppets! // 5.0 // 27 Nov. 2015 // By

 on 19 Jan. 2016 // Nice items and kids love them, sweep best cos he has a squeekie. Whilst the puppets are a good size externally, they are quite small inside so only a smallish/medium hand will fit properly. Which is a real shame and a poor oversight. Also Sooty's wand is sown on and so doesnt move properly. It would have been better to velcro it so you could use it on sooty and sweep.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Buy-For-Less-Online"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£18.38""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""ABCZoneLtd"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£14.33""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Gameseek"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£19.59""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Otherland UK"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£16.79""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""World Wide Shopping Mall Ltd"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£19.75""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£19.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""ElectricGemZ"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£18.49""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Midco Toys Ltd"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£22.32""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""Pint Sized People Ltd"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£19.99""}, {""Seller_name_10""=>""Dobege Collectables"", ""Seller_price_10""=>""£26.87""}]}"

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 22 Mar. 2011 // This is a fun puppet for a child from about age 5 to a young-at-heart adult.Like all Puppet Company puppets, the monster is well-made from quality fabrics ie thick plush polyester 'fur' and child-safe eyes.  Although probably intended as a child's toy, the puppet is also suitable for use by an adult, eg to amuse and entertain a child or in a performance.  One of the most appealing features is the opening mouth which is workable and opens to create various facial expressions and help with expressing emotion.  On opening wide, the monster can be made to smile broadly which can be quite a surprise if the mouth has been kept shut for the earlier part of his performance.  The mouth is also fitted with a loud 'squeaker' which I personally would find quite annoying so it was instantlly removed with a quick snip.A recommended and value-for-money purchase for anyone, either child or adult, who enjoys playing with puppets. | the munsterrrrr // 4.0 // 13 July 2010 // By

The face is really funny and I believe it will be found amusing by people of different ages. also i hadnt realised when i had bought it that it squeaked when you moved its mouth, so it wouldnt be ideal for like a ventriloquist thing.Overall the puppet looks great, and my friend who is a keen fan of 'Avenue Q' loved it. | Fantastic puppets! // 5.0 // 14 Feb. 2013 // By

Very well built, definitely worth the money.  The blue and green one is long and thin and I have seen this one with different 'hairstyles'.  He's got great eyes, a very energetic character, but the best thing about these is that you make the puppet personal with your own interaction.

When you open and close his mouth he squeaks. He is made of very hairy fabric, so no good if you have very small children, but looks suitably ""monster"" like for my four year old! I imagine he will have a lot of use popping up from behind doors and sofas to ""scare"" us all. Hes easy to use and I think we'll have a lot of fun with him. (I think it's a ""he""!)

 on 15 July 2013 // Great toy for the price. We've had our John Deere Monster Treads for over a year and it's still in great condition after a lot of rough and tumble play. The body of the vehicle is plastic but the tyres have a thick, rubber outer which makes for great traction and prevents slipping. There are three lots of sound and light effects when you press the buttons on top of the cab and the battery hasn't run out...it's still loud!.

 on 16 Aug. 2015 // This was my first Gunpla build; it's a really nice set.Tips for first-timers: buy a good hobby knife + a pair of cutters which are designed for Gunpla (from a Japanese brand). That'll make your life a LOT easier.The build was easy enough: being my first time I of course made a couple of mistakes - I flipped the arm around (no biggie), but I also accidentally cut a clip off. Thankfully superglue fixed that.One thing I noticed is that the knives are damaged on the edges you clip them off. This is of course expected from the injection molding, but I'd love to know what the best way is to touch them up. If anyone has tips, they'd be appreciated :)The box was extremely well packaged, and I'm very happy with the service :) The only downside is that delivery to The Netherlands is very expensive, so I had it delivered to my parents in the UK.

Not overly complicated and there are different levels of play with suggestions for alternative game rules. He found it addictive at first and we played many games one after the other.

The box is compact, cards are durable and sturdy and they are stored easily with the egg-timer in the box - it is fun but for the younger children as an adult will need to play along too and read the 'big' words they can't.  It is a good games for observation, counting, colours etc. Set a short period of time to play it as attention can wander if played too long. The games are pitched at different ages so buy the correct age for your child.  I will be buying the older versions when my grandchild reac as it is really educational.

The spots and bar are nicely painted with no smudging etc, All of them are clean on the back and the same size. Maybe some of the poor reviews were just bad luck?  I would have happily paid more for a better quality 10mm thick coloured spot set, but couldn't find anything between these and a very expensive set of Dal Negro ones. They are cheap and perfectly ok.

It comes with a set of picture cards to show you which pieces you can use and color coded for difficulty. You can also divide the board into different sizes which again alters the difficulty.

It's kept our 8 and 5 year olds (playing different difficulty levels) entertained for many a wet afternoon. The game is very well made with solid wooden pieces and board and I would imagine it will last for years.

TOP 100 REVIEWER on 7 Dec. 2009 // These cards consist of two types of card - one half with drawings of various coins on; and the other half has monetary amounts on.The rule cards suggest playing pairs and snap.  There are a couple of others that you can play too, yes they are similar to pairs but the do shake things up a little.These cards are very good for teaching people how to calculate the money in their hand.  I would also suggest that you can use the cards in conjunction with real change to help with understanding of real money.In fact they can be used in the same was as the money calculation ""game"" in the Brain Training games for the Nintendo DS.These are fun as well as educational for all the family. | educational // 5.0 // 2 Jan. 2010 // By

We play GO fish and use them as flash cards, so they resite whats on the card and/or immediately tell you what is the cards value.

 on 5 Jun. 2013 // How it works:The Pallino is low-tech and works via mechanics to allow you to make mosaic designs out of coloured balls. The balls are enclosed under the see-through plastic cover. To begin, you tilt the Pallino to tip the balls from the reservoir, up to the top where balls can be channeled, one by one, through the mechanism. Using two hands, you hold down a button that corresponds to the collum you want to drop the ball into, as you give the 'enter' button a good tap, which shoots a ball along the channel and into that collum. Balls of colours that aren't wanted can be exited back into the reservoir. The Pallino has fold out props so that it can make use of gravity. The collums can be emptied one at a time, using a 'reset' switch, so when you make a mistake, you don't have to start completely from scratch. There are double-sided picture cards to follow or you can make up your own pictures or designs.Who would enjoy it:This toy takes some patience to make a picture but it is tactile and engaging in its simplicity. When you begin a picture, it's almost impulsive to continue until it's finished. The Pallino is not a flashy 'cool' toy, but it has real child appeal and is likely to be returned to again and again because new creative ideas can be made. It also makes an excellent travel toy. The Pallino would suit any child and some adults, especially those with autistic spectrum disorders who may enjoy the sorting, systems and repetition involved, as well as the colourful visual aspect.What to be aware of:The Pallino toy relies on physics so don't expect perfection in smooth useage as though it was software. For example, sometimes a few balls escape through the 'exit' channel, back into the reservoir when you only wanted one ball to pass through.Read more › | good toy // 4.0 // 28 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 26 Aug. 2010 // The game of Mexican trains is addictive, but also has many rule variations, so make sure all players agree on the rules beforehand - failure in this area can lead to tears!  The rules included in this set are open to interpretation, but this is not important as long you agree what they are to be.This particular set of double-twelve dominoes is well made with clear coloured dots, although some of the colours are similar (inevitable with twelve colours).  The dominoes have a nice feel to them and enough weight to be stable when standing up (you don't want your dominoes falling over for all to see).  There was no smearing of the dot colouring and no marks on the underside (as reported in another review).Be prepared for the tin box (incidentally it is decorated differently to that shown on the web page) to be damaged, as the packaging it was sent in was woefully inadequate.  I spent half an hour in the shed gently teasing the ""bruised"" corners back into a good enough shape for the lid to fit acceptably well.  This was a pity as the box is attractive.All in all, worth the £9 paid and would recommend it to all.PS have just spent a week in France staying with French friends and had to leave the game behind!  Another is on order.PPS Sep 12 - the design shown now (red with two dominoes) is the one I received (quite different to the design being shown when I bought it over two years ago). | Mexican Train game for the family! // 5.0 // 20 Mar. 2010 // By

This particular set contains the centre piece for the Mexican Train game, but no mini-train markers (train shapes or otherwise) which disappointed the kids (I guess U can prob buy at a toy shop, otherwise just use coins or buttons at home for markers).Great game for all the family. Kids can learn strategy and counting up their 'dots' to see how many points they get. Granny's really competitive!! | Great price let down by awful quality issues // 2.0 // 10 April 2012 // By

 on 10 April 2012 // I've had to return this set as unfit for purpose, because they're so badly marked on the back that we can easily identify individual dominoes - no good when you're drawing from the pool and need a 12! Tried to clean them, but it looks like its just stained resin being used. Shame, because the price is right, but no good at all if you can tell which ones which without turning them over. | Poor Quality Standards // 4.0 // 25 Jan. 2013 // By

However the quality of the dominoe is very poor:The coloured dots are not consistant coloursThe colour of the dots are not fully in the dimple of the dominoeThere are indentations on the back of some dominoesThere are at least 2 shades of white used for the basic dominoeThere is differing thickness of dominoeI have contacted Pressman Toys twice through thier web site and have never recieved a reply.Double 12 Colour Dot Dominoes in Tin | Good basic set of Double 12 Dominoes // 4.0 // 13 Jan. 2010 // By

 on 13 Jan. 2010 // Generally very happy with this purchase.  The dots are clear and easy to see and vary in size helping make distinguishing the number of dots easier.  The colours are bright although often very similar colours are used for numbers quite close to each other, can be confusing in dim light.  There are a few smudges of paint on the reverse and sides of some dominoes and so far we haven't been able to remove these.  The dominoes do vary slightly in size.  This has caused problems as we bought a Fundex Mexican Train Game Hub Set (produces a train noise!) directly from Infinity Games (no postage and packaging to pay unlike Amazon!) with the view to using this with these dominoes .  Unfortunately some of the dominoes do not fit in the central well, not too much of a problem but not as satisfactory as it could be. The set does come with a very basic Mexican train game hub in the tin so not necessary to get a separate hub, we just like the one that makes a noise! Buying the two components separately did save us a considerable amount of money though (based on the price of the Fundex Mexican Train Game tin set from Amazon)! | Mexican Train // 5.0 // 20 July 2010 // By

    Take turns to roll the three die together. The dice with functions on tells you whether to add, subtract or multiply the two numbers showing on the other  die. So if you get  a 6 and an 8 and the function dice says multiply, then your score is 48. If the next player scores more than 48 he/she wins a cupcake. If they score less than 48, you win the cupcake. If one of you throws an Aaahh, then you throw again and if it's another Aaahh, you lose that round. The first player to win all 3 cupcakes wins the game. If one player has two cupcakes and the other has one cupcake, you have to keep playing rounds until you can take the third cupcake from the other player.

Each player or team is given 4 questions from a card. When all 4 answers are given correctly, they have to guess the connection among them. A letter from the word Linkee is won and the object is to win all the letters which spell out Linkee.

 on 25 Sept. 2014 // I have to confess that I'm not much of a fan of Trivial Pursuits, the questions are always so difficult. Plus, some people in my family always take ages to answer the blooming questions. So, I thought I would test out a more up-to-date Trivia game on my folks. Result? Smiles all round. In fact there was a lot of shouting and screaming; which, in my book, is the sign of a great game! It's quick to play and easy to understand, even our 'Tweenagers' were getting stuck in.

 on 1 Jan. 2016 // We were given this as a gift as we like to to play games with family over the festive period. A group of six of us played in two teams. We took turns being the question master alternating from team to team so everyone was involved. Each team was a man down when they were providing the question master. This is a fanatastic game as no one has to sit out like in Trivial pursuit when if you are on the losing team it is ages before you get a go. $ questions are asked and the first person to shout out the link between them gets that card which has a letter from LINKEE on it Sometimes we got the link on question 1, sometimes we waited till question 2 but of course the other team might get the link too so you had to be fast. Sometimes we never got the link and at other times with 4 questions and a bit of thought it came. The links don't require knowledge just the sort of mind to see the link. That is what is so great as you don't have to be good at general knowledge to play.A bit hit with our family. | Fun game // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 27 Dec. 2015 // This is a fun game, we purchased this as our new family game for Christmas.It's a simple game, you get four questions you have to answer and then you or your team have to work out the link, if you can't answer one of the questions it can make it harder.  There is a clue included but with a missing answer can still be hard.  The way to win is win cards, the cards all have a letter on them and you need to spell Linkee.We had a great time playing this game, the question reader may need a poker face as you don't want to  make it to easy.

 on 13 Jan. 2016 // Like the game and it all arrived ok but was disappointed to find once playing it that it was the American edition of the game so some of the questions will not be relevant for us in the UK which is pointless if we need to know answers and link them up e.g. There were 4 questions that should have linked to Monopoly but one of the questions related to a place specifically on the U.S. Monopoly board.

 on 24 Oct. 2008 // Amazing - an educational game that my children don't mind playing!  My 6 and 9 year old love this.  You have 10 seconds in which to memorise as much information as possible about a country - flags, towns, exports etc.  Then you roll a dice and have to answer a numbered question about the country.  That's all there is to it.  If you answer correctly, you keep the card for that country.  The person with the most number of cards at the end of the game wins.  If I sat down and quizzed my children on their knowledge of flags, towns, countries, they'd find it really dull.  For some reason the egg-timer and dice turn this into a fun game for them.

 on 16 Oct. 2009 // We bought this game for my son's 9th birthday having no knowledge of it prior to seeing it here on Amazon.  We read the previous reviews and thought for the price it was worth a shot.  (Sick of the toy cupboard full of games which promise ""hours of fun"" etc which never get played) This little box is brilliant!  Our son is very much into factual learning at the moment and the wide variety of questions from colours on a flag to border countries and animals makes it a really great game for all.  The cards seem very durable being made of thick card and the language used is good for helping with reading/vocabulary.  Even Grandma with her great general knowledge has fun yet there are still enough challenges to keep it interesting.  The 10 minute rule has to be stretched as we so enjoy it that we keep going for another 10. It is compact portable and simple which is great for traveling and means you can pick it up anytime there are a few spare minutes which entertains board kids.  We have been so impressed that we are going to buying some more for gifts. | A good, educational game! // 5.0 // 3 Aug. 2009 // By

They both find it fun and interesting.I am pleased with it because it is about observation and remembering things about various countries, including flags, national emblems etc. | Real fun and educational at the same time! // 5.0 // 5 Feb. 2009 // By

 on 5 Feb. 2009 // I bought this for the children for Christmas and we're still playing with it. It's a lot of fun and the fact that the aim of the game is who wins the most number of cards in 10 min., means that you can have little sessions of it, so it's appropriate for children whose attention span is limited. It's fun because one might get the same card but different questions according to the number shown on the die. I'm thinking of getting some other ones from the series. Educational. Good buy. | Great game! // 5.0 // 11 April 2009 // By

We all got some right & some wrong so not too easy or too hard for anyone.

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 17 Dec. 2015 // My husband and I are big animal fans, and we like trivial pursuit, but often find the questions a bit out of our realm of interest. This makes it much more fun for us, and also for quicker games since one of us tends to win fairly quickly. Note that this does not come with a board, cheese wheel or score-wedges like the full game. It comes with a carrying case, a pack of cards, and the dice to roll. You'll need to keep score yourself, or use the original board if you have a full set. You could easily fit a second pack of cards into this case if you wanted to mix it up with a different theme, and that's what we intend to do on our next camping set, as this is a lot more portable than the main game. | Do you have a PhD in Zoology? // 2.0 // 25 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 8 Aug. 2006 // A brilliant game based on very simple principles. The game consists of a bag, a timer and oval shaped cards on which there are the names of three people - fiction and non-fiction. The basic aim of the game is to describe as many people on the cards which are picked out of the bag to your team without naming the actual person in a set time limit. The game is reliant on verbal dexterity and quick thinking and anyone can play it.Sounds very basic but it fantastic fun and creates a great atmosphere in any party. It also sounds easy but it can be very difficult especially when you get stuck on an obscure person to describe. The instructions give a variety of ways to play the game but the best way to play is to get stuck in and play the basic game first as outlined in the first paragraph.Highly recommended. | Fun for all the family // 5.0 // 9 April 2005 // By

The game isn't aimed at anyone particularly as all the names, characters, and places in the bag come from different genres and time periods.This game makes the time fly and although it does have quite a long life it can become boring if you play it constantly round after round. | A dream game to use once the kids are in bed // 5.0 // 18 Nov. 2003 // By

How refreashing to have a simple concept that requires no batteries, wires or plugs and is as easy to carry round as an evening clutch bag!! This game comes to dinner parties, and on every holiday we take. It manages to fill the room with laughter whilst learning. Although this depends how much wine has been consumed. Why not pit the girls against the boy's to see who is the best and to see who will try to cheat. This never fails to bond even strangers into the fiercest team...The only addition needed by the manufacturers is to create more cards...Enjoy the battle! | A great way to pass the boredom of a family gathering // 5.0 // 20 Nov. 2003 // By

 on 20 Nov. 2003 // With the prospect of Christmas looming many people will be dreading the thought of spending an excessive period of time through obligation with various family members.  If this is you then Who's in the Bag can help.It is like the name game bit and the end of the TV quiz show of 'They think it's all over' but without Rory McGrath and Nick Hancock.  It is pitched at children and adults with a variety of different people so you may or may not know what this person does but it is fun to try and infer the name without saying it.  It is less contraversial than Monopoly and causes less arguments than Scrabble and certainly makes the time fly, as well as allowing you and your loved ones some time to relax and have a laugh and forget what you had been stressing about all day. | Who's In the Bag - Fantastic Game! // 5.0 // 7 Feb. 2009 // By

Like the other reviewers it is the simplest premise possible and provides hours and hours of great fun. Anywhere it's ever been taken has resulted in the same amount of pleasure being enjoyed by others and then usually to be borrowed back or people buying their own. The one star review has been answered by a few people so if you're in any doubt, ignore that review (having read the replies) and purchase.

 on 2 Feb. 2014 // Yes the idea of this game is simple and yes there is not a lot in the box - but if you give it a chance you can have a lot of fun with this game. We always have lots of fun playing at dinner parties and have played with younger members, but just give them a bit more artistic license with how they convey the message (allowing them sounds like etc...) If you are not sure who any of the people are, then I can imagine it might be as much fun - but there are three to choose from on the card and it forces you to just be a bit more imaginative (I personally think the people on the cards are very accessible - lots of Hollywood actors etc..). It is very much geared towards the British market though with some of the names relating to politicians like Tony Blair (although I think you would have to have been living on the moon to not know who most of them are!)

Good fun family game but best played in mixed age group teams as some of the questions are geared towards the more mature.  Scoring by moving to the appropriate coloured square also makes the game more fun as answering another teams question after they have got it wrong can propel you forwards and similarly, if you get your question wrong, it can really hold you back.All round good fun game that the whole family enjoyed. | Best of British // 5.0 // 4 Jan. 2011 // By

The cards are the right design to be able to use them as an add-on to an existing set, and the modified game-play that comes with the cards is excellent for when you're travelling or just want a quick game. My only complaint is that the deck is strictly movie-only questions. As a fan of the books first and primarily, it would have been good to have at least one category for trivia that is book specific given there are a number of differences. We've found ourselves double-checking answers on more than one card because we were sure the card was wrong, only to find our answers came from the books rather than the films. | awesome // 5.0 // 30 Jan. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 9 Jan. 2015 // Many people seem to class this as a boring figure. OK, its no marine or alien, but I am delighted to have a Bishop figure.The figure is mostly excellent, nearly perfect. The sculpt is flawless, I cant find any flaws in it. His jumpsuit, wrist watch and trainers are so well painted and detailed - NECA really are my favourite figure company.The articulation is awkward. NECA seemed focused on hiding his articulation, which helps the sculpt, but limits display possibilities.His accessories are also very good. He comes with a torch, a knife and an interchangeable hand to hold the knife.Why not five stars? The sloppy paint on the head takes away from the PERFECT sculpt. It really is a shame.Sloppy hairline, wonky eyeball and dodgy nostrils! IF you find one with spot-on paint though, this is a five star figure!Comes in Clamshell packaging - Dog Alien and KAne also available in the series. | Well done neca for another brilliant aliens figure bishop is my favourite android he is ... // 5.0 // 11 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 16 Jan. 2014 // This is a truly incredible figure! Full marks to the sculptor for this - it's a truly UNCANNY likeness of the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. I've been anticipating this figure for months and months. My expectations were pretty high as I own the Neca quarter scale classic predator, which is a VERY hard act to follow... When I saw the final prototype pictures of Dutch I knew I had to get it pre-ordered! I can happily say that finally, figure in hand it does not disappoint! The sculpt and paint apps are nothing short of exceptional, especially for a figure this size (18"" approx) and (relatively) cheap price. The quarter scale Predator line Neca have been making in recent years have really raised the bar in terms of value for money collectibles.The skin is shaded perfectly and has a wet look to it, which really captures the humidity of the jungle. The details on the clothing and accessories is really very nice. There is absolutely no mistaking who the figure is - it is Arnold through and through! There is also a good amount of articulation in the figure, despite it's size although I do offer a word of warning when posing Dutch...I have a few of the Neca quarter scale figures (Alien, Terminator, classic Pred etc.) and have found some stand up a lot better than others.... and some, like the Alien in particular are VERY prone to falling over if you're not super careful with balancing the figure when posing. I've had the Dutch figure two days and already 3 times, in a very 'standard' leg stance the figure has stood fine for a while and then taken a dive randomly hours later... not good if it's on a high shelf or hits a hard surface!Read more › | Ankle joints!! why Neca why? // 3.0 // 7 Dec. 2014 // By

 on 7 Dec. 2014 // I hate to give this 3 stars because the sculpt and accessories are really top quality but... Neca, when will you ever learn? loose ankle joints combined with heavy figures mean shelf dives. I really wish they would forget the ankle joints as they are so poorly implemented and just go for dynamic poses instead. I know that is not a popular view, but I have had Dutch, Robocop and Predator all fall off a 6.5 foot shelf now and let me tell you, 3 kkilos of heavy plastic figure falling towards you is not something you want to experience more than once in your lifetime. He's a great figure, looks fantastic fighting my classic 18 inch Predator, but for goodness sake make double and tripple sure he's posed stably before you leave him alone. My personal advice would be to leave the  assault rifle off him until he's proven he can stand up, in the hot summer for at least 3 weeks without any shelf diving. | Received the item in perfect condition!

VINE VOICE on 13 Sept. 2014 // My daughters have enjoyed making hair bands with this lovely kit. 'Crafting' if that is even the correct term is pretty big in our house and although you can acquire many of the pieces you get here from various craft shops this, as a starter set is really good. It certainly lets the imagination loose and my daughters have hair bands of their own creation now. That unique element is something you can't get from wider commercial products and we like the fact that the girls have sat down, created their own hair bands and used the fruits of their labour. That is a nice thing. I have to give 5 stars because the smiles from two of my daughters (the ones old enough to wear hair bands) are so wide wearing their own hand-made hair bands (ok mums hands were pretty instrumental) speaks for itself. | Hippie chick crafting // 5.0 // 16 Sept. 2014 // By

You make eight fabric plaited bands in all to which you can add flowers and beads.  The instructions are good and easy to follow.  It was a great activity for a rainy afternoon and mess free.  I liked the fact that they could manage it themselves, though they needed a bit of help finishing off.  Overall great kit for the price and one I'll buy again for sleepovers or a birthday gift.

TOP 100 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 17 Sept. 2014 // My nieces (6 and 4 years old) are very creative and love making things and absolutely loved making this set. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has creative children who love making things as it's a really sweet set. The picture on the box is a bit misleading as it looks like you are making firm head bands i.e. the type with a plastic band when you are not as you are making soft headband style hair bands.  You get enough elastic bands to make 8 hair bands but these are easily duplicated with other elastic hair bands and so you can get more than 8 hair bands out of the set if you wish.  To make the hair bands you simply plait the supplied stretchy fabric together and thread on the flowers with bead centers as you go.  The finished product is really nice but the ends are a little messy looking however this is not a problem if they are going underneath your hair.  My nieces really enjoyed making these last week and if done carefully you can dismantle the hair bands and make new designs so the set seems to have a good bit of longevity in it.

VINE VOICE on 13 Sept. 2014 // The Galt Brilliant Hair Band set is a fantastic gift for any creative girl, or girls. It allowed three little girls, aged 5,6, and 7, to have great fun together. They all pitched in to create some lovely hair bands, and the finished products did not look like a typical craft item made by a child. Instead, they looked like something you might buy in a shop, really lovely quality for a craft kit.The box contains two bags of flowers, some larger than the others. It also contains, a bag of bright coloured fabric strips which have a great stretchy feel to them. Also included are beads and eight strong elastic bands. There is no need for glue to be used, so this is a mess-free craft kit! Brilliant!In terms of difficulty, all that are required in terms of skills are the ability to thread and plait. Everything is easily manageable for a child of around six and up.Overall, I would highly recommend this set. It is a lovely little craft kit for a child on their own, or as a group activity between friends or siblings. | Cute hairbands to design for the 6+ age group. // 4.0 // 7 Sept. 2014 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 7 Sept. 2014 // Simple to make set of stretchy headbands. They're not rigid bands and you need to tie them to keep them in place. They don't tie too neatly if you're leaving the ends on show but are fine if you can hide them under longer hair. There are 8 elastic hair bands, 30 fabric strips (assorted sizes), 25 flowers and 25 beads inside the box. To make the bands you simply plait the fabric strips, add beads and flowers to your own design then attached the finished plait to the band. Easy to undo and start again. I can see most little girls having fun with this. Brilliant Hair Bands has a 6+ safety recommendation. Nice little bit of fun and I'm happy to recommend. | No mess, no fuss, just cuteness! // 4.0 // 18 Sept. 2014 // By

Inside is everything you need to make 8 cute stretchy hairbands, including fabric to plait, beads and flowers to thread through, and elastic to tie the finished product onto and use as a band.The materials are good quality, the flower shapes are pretty and the colours of the fabric range from bright to pastel, so there's a really nice range. The fact that you can design your own headband and use whatever colours, positionings of beads etc that you wish makes it a nice creative activity and means that everyone ends up with something special and individual to them to wear afterwards.It's a really nice, simple crafting activity with no mess, no glue or complicated actions. The finished products look pretty good, although the place where they tie at the bottom is a bit messy, so it's best to try and keep it covered by hair!

 on 4 July 2014 // My 2 1/2 year old is completely snooker loopy(doesn't seem to mind that this is actually a pool table). I brought this table for him as it is a great size for him (all the others seem to be atleast 3ft and too high for him).It was only delivered today but form the moment he saw the box he went mad jumping up and down an was so excited I had to let him have it straight away.So far we are not disappointed, it appears to be of reasonable build and quite sturdy, as do the accessories that come with it.  He has been playing on it for 2 hours solid now and he loves it!Some people have commented about the size of the holes to get the balls out but we are not having any problems as the balls seem to roll down to the centre when pocketed and he is having no problem at all getting his chubby little hands in to retrieve them (I've also tried and I can manage with ease).Well priced, packed and delivered quickly.We recommend this table, it's fab! | Almost a great wee table // 2.0 // 18 Mar. 2014 // By

 on 18 Mar. 2014 // So much about this is good.....the size is great...not too big but big enough to play properly. Cues and balls are good quality and the brush is a nice touch.However, the downside is the build quality. We had to tighten a screw underneath when we opened it for the first time and last week the whole plastic pocket system on one side has fallen off. This was connected to the playing surface so it is now half a centimere under the height of the cushions....not good.Almost a great product for the price but may not last you long if our build quality is typical of their other tables. | Exellent quality and value // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2011 // By

 on 1 Jan. 2012 // One of the few toys that hold the attention of all ages.  Adults think they aren't interested in dominos until they watch a 5 year old setting them up and then they just have to get involved.  They start taking over the design and everyone wants to be the one to start the knock down.This is a lovely set. The right amount of dominoes, enough to build a decent size course but also to pack away small enough to store easily.  Well cut wooden dominos.  A handful of trick pieces, like bridge and chime etc.helpful hint. . .when setting up with small children best to leave a gap every ten dominos or so until you are ready to knock down, saves on tears when they accidently knock them over.would certainly be happy to buy this again as gift for another child.5* | Domino racing // 4.0 // 20 Oct. 2009 // By

 on 12 May 2013 // My grandson and I have had fun building various domino runs, but the quality of the tiles is poor, with some tiles not cut straight. Very frustrating especially as an uneven tile set off the run before completing! The tiles are just a little too thin and light.

 on 13 Feb. 2015 // We are great fans of wooden and toys for our children. But this kit is so poorly made that our children are not interested to play with it. Some of the domino pieces were not even solid wood and snapped in half easily. The contraptions are flimsy and so not stay together and the stairs were not designed accurately for the domino effect to work well. the bell is a metal tube made of inappropriate material, just some cheap metal tube that makes no sound when hit by a piece of domino or anything else for that matter. We are too late to return this piece of cheaply made rubbish kit, so £16 wasted. I had better kits of Domino when I was a child, some 20 years ago.

They are quite thick compared with ordinary wooden ones and play better if you stand them up on edge rather than try and hold them in your hand.Definitely a 5* product packed in a plastic box (like the old wooden boxes) and usefully includes a set of games instructions.Don't buy cheaper ones. | Perfect // 5.0 // 26 Feb. 2014 // By

Didn't know much about dominoes but now I understand what ""spinners"" mean; the metal part in the middle makes it easier to shuffle as they spin around when you turn them upside down, looking like mini bumper cars.
